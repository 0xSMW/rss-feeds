      <title>SF Really Wants To Give Black People $5M Checks</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/sf-really-wants-to-give-black-people</link>
      <description>the city's reparations scheme is dreaming big, delivering nothing, and derailing city funds</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Who wants to be a millionaire?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors just unanimously approved creating a reparations fund for San Francisco’s black residents. This is the latest move in a half-decade of amusingly absurd efforts by the city to create a reparations program. The fund, &lt;a href="https://sfgov.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&amp;amp;ID=15028623&amp;amp;GUID=4594DAF9-F528-40F7-9FE0-ACF58D89B81B"&gt;established&lt;/a&gt; this week, will “support and implement” the recommendations of a loony plan that wants to literally cut thousands of $5 million checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://sfgov.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&amp;amp;ID=15028623&amp;amp;GUID=4594DAF9-F528-40F7-9FE0-ACF58D89B81B"&gt;established&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apologists online quickly rushed to defend the decision of the board, commenting that this ordinance simply created a fund to collect money without allocating any of it. But this move clearly signals that the city intends to move taxpayer dollars towards the cause of reparations. After all, why go through the hassle of a board vote when a simple GoFundMe could accomplish the same thing?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>State Capacity Isn't Fascism</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/state-capacity-isnt-fascism</link>
      <description>tech companies give the government, historically dumb and slow, cutting-edge tools to enforce the law of the land. don't like it? change the law, don't blame the toolmakers.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some of the self-styled thought leaders in tech have started handing out the same professional advice to young engineers: Don’t work at Palantir. The software company I once worked at that allows their customers to better manage their data is apparently shredding democracy and working there would make them complicit in a totalitarian takeover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific beef is Palantir’s contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The idea that this work is inherently authoritarian was recently reinforced by about a dozen sitting lawmakers, including Massachusetts Senators Edward Markey and Elizabeth Warren and “Squad” Reps Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib, who sent a joint &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden_aoc_palantir_letter_061725.pdf"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to Palantir leadership accusing them of “enabling and profiting from serious violations of Federal law by the Trump Administration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden_aoc_palantir_letter_061725.pdf"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the thought leaders nor our beloved public servants have specified which law exactly Palantir is violating. And that’s because there isn’t one. This is an empty accusation. Palantir is, in fact, part of a much-needed tech upgrade in government. The people claiming that it’s “building the police state” just don’t like what existing immigration laws are, and they’d rather tar Palantir than do the normal work of politics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Data Center Water Crisis Isn't Real</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/andy-masley-ai-water-crisis-isnt-real</link>
      <description>one guy is single-handedly correcting the ai water doomerism with a calculator and a chatbot</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;By day, Andy Masley was working as a director for an &lt;a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/"&gt;effective altruism&lt;/a&gt; community in DC. By night, he was writing blogs for his Substack &lt;a href="https://andymasley.substack.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Weird Turn Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, such as: “A failure to take violence seriously is bad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/"&gt;effective altruism&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://andymasley.substack.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Weird Turn Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Weird Turn Pro&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But last January, Andy noticed something curious. When he’d passively mention using ChatGPT at parties, people would respond: “Don’t you know how bad that is for the climate?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And I would try to suss out what they meant by that,” Andy told us in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Claude, some back-of-the-napkin math, a guiding desire for things to make sense, and his background as a high school physics teacher (“explaining how much a watt hour is turns out to be really useful,” he told us), Andy identified a concerning pattern: the country’s top papers, from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, were stoking fears with &lt;a href="https://andymasley.substack.com/p/individual-ai-use-is-not-bad-for"&gt;almost certainly wrong&lt;/a&gt; or woefully misleading statistics about data centers’ water use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://andymasley.substack.com/p/individual-ai-use-is-not-bad-for"&gt;almost certainly wrong&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he wrote about it — at length. In these dispatches, which are definitely not designed for the modern attention span, Andy defines terms, aggregates data in charts, and walks people through his math and general thought process for tens of pages at a time. He didn’t expect the essays to blow up. Mainly, he just wanted the writing on-hand when people got mad at him at parties. But maybe because the message is so contrarian — data centers are not taking all the water, they’re not projected to, and sometimes they’re actually &lt;em&gt;improving&lt;/em&gt; water access — his Substack has gone gangbusters (he’s up to 5,200 subscribers from roughly 0). Just in the last few weeks, he’s exposed major errors in a leading book on the subject, earned the nickname “AI water guy” in the &lt;em&gt;Pirate Wires&lt;/em&gt; Slack channel, made his case on &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ tech podcast (a lesser accomplishment, to be sure), and pretty much single-handedly started a national conversation on AI water doomerism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;improving&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Pirate Wires&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bd196c4d-70db-4b6f-8f43-6166ec8a4bc4_544x518.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how could Andy’s thesis possibly be true, given the coverage?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Terms and Conditions of America</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/a-complete-timeline-of-the-somali</link>
      <description>how somali immigrants in minnesota (and now maine?) sent billions of taxpayer dollars to islamic terrorists — and what happens when we stop expecting people to assimilate</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The first rule of assimilating into America is simple: don’t move here and steal a billion dollars from the welfare state. We can get to baseball stats and Thanksgiving sides after we nail that one. “Don’t accidentally turn Minnesota into a funding arm for Al‑Shabaab” is a pretty low bar for joining a country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minnesota’s $1 billion-plus fraud scandal, initially &lt;a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/minnesota-welfare-fraud-somalia-al-shabaab"&gt;broken&lt;/a&gt; by Ryan Thorpe and Chris Rufo in &lt;em&gt;City Journal&lt;/em&gt;, is what happens when a high‑trust Scandinavian welfare model collides with imported clan politics. Somali‑run nonprofits and shell companies looted child‑nutrition, housing, and autism programs for years while liberal officials, activists, and Ilhan‑world staffers warned that scrutiny was “racist.” Assimilation — one flag, one loyalty — used to be the price of entry. Minnesota fraud is what happens when we stop charging it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Mastermind Behind AOC Could Be SF's Next Congressman</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-mastermind-behind-aoc-could-be</link>
      <description>saikat chakrabarti built "the squad." now he's running for congress to turn them into a party.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Last month, prolific stock trader and former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced her retirement. Copy traders everywhere are on suicide watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the usual coronation ceremony in California’s 11th Congressional District, a tight race is emerging between two frontrunners. Vying for Pelosi’s soon-to-be vacant throne: State Senator Scott Wiener, and Saikat Chakrabarti, a former software engineer with fingerprints all over the new socialist left. Leftist NIMBY city supervisor Connie Chan has also jumped in, and while it’s hard to imagine someone who won’t even make her X account public winning the race, she’s already received a couple strong endorsements, and the large Asian-American population of San Francisco is likely to be a notable boon for her campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiener represents a more run-of-the-mill left-wing degeneracy that is right at home in San Francisco. He’s built a reputation of improving the golden state through authoring legislation to house biological males in women’s prisons and reclassifying &lt;em&gt;intentional&lt;/em&gt; spread of HIV/AIDS from a felony to a misdemeanor. And of course,  Saikat’s campaign is attempting to outflank him from even further left. Saikat is also the candidate with most of the energy behind his campaign. If recent trends in cities across the country are any indication (local chapters of the DSA have absolutely bodied the machine Democrats and cannibalized their party), Saikat has a very strong chance of becoming your next congressman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;intentional&lt;/em&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>No, We Shouldn’t Ban Waymos Over a Cat</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/no-we-shouldnt-ban-waymos-over-a</link>
      <description>on kitkat, the beloved sf feline who was run over by an autonomous vehicle, and jackie fielder, the pandering sf politician who now wants to ban the vehicles altogether</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The tragedy struck close to midnight in San Francisco’s Mission District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KitKat, a well-known, beloved neighborhood feline, affectionately referred to as “the Mayor of 16th Street,” was out for a stroll near deli/liquor store Randa’s Market (where he was a regular fixture, often &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_sQPtihO-B/"&gt;featured&lt;/a&gt; on the store’s Instagram page) when an autonomous Waymo approached to pick up riders in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_sQPtihO-B/"&gt;featured&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened next is disputed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Waymo, the darling cat mayor pulled something of a risky maneuver on his saunter that fateful evening, causing all nine of his lives to be cut short. “While our vehicle was stopped to pick up passengers, a nearby cat darted under our vehicle as it was pulling away,” a spokesperson for the company explained in a statement, adding that Waymo would donate to a local animal rights organization in KitKat’s honor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bystanders on the night of the incident disagree with the company’s version of events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two anonymous eyewitnesses leaving a nearby bar &lt;a href="https://missionlocal.org/2025/10/waymo-confirms-its-car-killed-kitkat-mission-bodega-cat/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Mission Local they saw KitKat sitting directly in front of the Waymo in question for about seven seconds. They said the cat proceeded to walk underneath the vehicle, calmly making his way to the sidewalk, when the Waymo suddenly sped forward, running over the mayor’s hind legs before he eventually succumbed to his injuries (it’s a dangerous profession, public office).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://missionlocal.org/2025/10/waymo-confirms-its-car-killed-kitkat-mission-bodega-cat/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting aside for a moment the question of whose account was more truthful — the company that would stand to lose millions in court for lying to the public, or two nameless individuals who just had a few pops at midnight on a Monday — it’s worth stating a few things that should be obvious to your average first grader:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1) Cats do not typically have a good understanding of traffic laws.&lt;/strong&gt; This appears to be true of KitKat, who — in both the telling of Waymo &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; our anonymous onlookers — was in the middle of the street prior to getting hit. The middle of the street is where cars are known to drive. Cats, who rarely take driver’s education courses, often struggle to grasp this concept. Speaking of which…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;#1) Cats do not typically have a good understanding of traffic laws.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#2) Cats — and animals of all stripes — are frequently hit by cars.&lt;/strong&gt; It is a sad reality of modern transportation that, yes, animals are occasionally struck and killed by passing cars. And by occasionally, I mean it happens a fucking lot. While statistics here are difficult to quantify, on account of most animal-vehicle collisions go unreported, on account of we’ve generally just accepted it as an unfortunate but unavoidable consequence of getting from LA to SF in hours instead of weeks, one Federal Highway Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/08034/04.cfm?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; put the number at about &lt;em&gt;365 million vertebrates&lt;/em&gt; being killed annually on U.S. roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;#2) Cats — and animals of all stripes — are frequently hit by cars.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/08034/04.cfm?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;365 million vertebrates&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since autonomous vehicles such as Waymos are a relatively new innovation, only available in certain jurisdictions, it’s safe to assume that human drivers — not robots — have been involved in the vast majority of these animal deaths. Got it? Got it. But while I have you…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#3) When an animal is hit by a car, most people generally do not demand that all cars be banned indefinitely. &lt;/strong&gt;While I’m sure there are a few lovely nonbinary interns at PETA who would be the exception to this rule, most people &lt;em&gt;typically&lt;/em&gt; do not call for the dismantling of the federal highway system when a car hits an animal. It is a sad moment, especially when the victim is a beloved pet, but generally not one that prompts widespread pleas for a return to the 1700s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;#3) When an animal is hit by a car, most people generally do not demand that all cars be banned indefinitely. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;typically&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re all on the same page? Great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is with this context, then, that we return to KitKat’s death and the ensuing reactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mission District’s response was heartfelt at first. A cute little shrine was set up outside of Randa’s. Locals stopped by to drop off floral bouquets, photographs of their beloved mayor, notes bearing well-wishes as his soul entered the kingdom of Kitty Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/241be2e4-4b1f-4968-b117-2dfbd2e19250_560x558.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the story gained traction outside of SF, however, things rapidly spiraled into clown world absurdity…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media posts about KitKat’s death began pouring in. They blamed Waymo for committing a robotic hit job in cold blood, and eagerly folded the tragedy into broader ongoing crusades against self-driving cars/AI/tech writ large. Bountiful memes ensued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c715dec1-1da6-49a3-bdfc-14db0fc5ce36_1200x896.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f88982ce-9dd9-4270-9f4e-1cf892f92df5_977x977.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fe917dd1-88c5-459a-ae4a-28780cfb0a90_1184x984.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, the reaction grew even more unhinged. Multiple KitKat-inspired &lt;a href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/11/13/san-francisco-bodega-cat-s-death-sparked-memecoin-war/?taid=691639b449700a000167de3d&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;memecoins&lt;/a&gt; were launched by those seeking to capitalize on the viral attention. In news that will come as a surprise to literally nobody, at least one of those projects appears to have culminated in a blatant &lt;a href="https://x.com/CryptoStrtBets/status/1992394453198520518"&gt;rug pull&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/11/13/san-francisco-bodega-cat-s-death-sparked-memecoin-war/?taid=691639b449700a000167de3d&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;memecoins&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/CryptoStrtBets/status/1992394453198520518"&gt;rug pull&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One individual even wrote an entire opinion &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/waymo-cat-mission-san-francisco-21198945.php"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; in the San Francisco Chronicle — &lt;em&gt;from the perspective of KitKat “from the Great Beyond”&lt;/em&gt; (I am not making this up) — arguing for more local regulation on the AI front, and… ok you just have to read this:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I'm an American Trucker. Illegal Migrants Are Flooding My Industry.</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/im-an-american-trucker-illegal-migrants</link>
      <description>trucking companies are hiring barely-vetted migrants happy to work long hours for low pay, many of whom don't speak english or understand our driving culture — and they're wreaking havoc on the roads</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On October 21, a commercial truck &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/crash-jashanpreet-singh-california-ad268515fbe4ff67d9376c141e8995c5"&gt;collided&lt;/a&gt; with an SUV along Interstate 10 a few miles east of Los Angeles. The &lt;a href="https://x.com/boneheadtruckrs/status/1981002547809947721"&gt;dashcam&lt;/a&gt; footage instantly went viral: we witness the final moments of husband and wife Clarence and Lisa Nelson as their vehicle, stopped in traffic, is vaporized by the truck. Its driver? A 21-year-old illegal immigrant from India, Jashanpreet Singh, who didn’t stop or even attempt to slow down before impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/crash-jashanpreet-singh-california-ad268515fbe4ff67d9376c141e8995c5"&gt;collided&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/boneheadtruckrs/status/1981002547809947721"&gt;dashcam&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, Harjinder Singh, an Indian migrant who entered America illegally in 2018 and was (again, illegally) issued a commercial driver’s license by both Washington and California, attempted to execute an illegal U-turn with a semi across the Florida turnpike. Failing to check before making the turn, Mr. Singh pulled his truck right in front of a minivan doing 70pmh that had no chance to slow down or stop. The impact instantly killed all three people in the minivan. An &lt;a href="https://x.com/bruce_barrett/status/1958931273466224815?s=20"&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; of Singh standing next to his truck, showing what many saw as no remorse, went viral along with &lt;a href="https://x.com/Bubblebathgirl/status/1956927943986585703?s=20"&gt;dashcam&lt;/a&gt; footage and a video of Singh struggling to &lt;a href="https://x.com/FoxNews/status/1960702863065149611?s=20"&gt;speak English&lt;/a&gt; to police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/bruce_barrett/status/1958931273466224815?s=20"&gt;image&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/Bubblebathgirl/status/1956927943986585703?s=20"&gt;dashcam&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/FoxNews/status/1960702863065149611?s=20"&gt;speak English&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not being able to communicate with police is one thing, but if you can’t speak English you probably can’t read American road signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On March 13, a recent arrival from Ethiopia, Solomun Weldekeal Araya, was driving a rig pulling a trailer for Amazon. He crashed through 17 stopped vehicles before finally coming to a halt on Interstate 35 in Austin, Texas, killing five people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 9, ICE arrested an Uzbeki illegal migrant and wanted terrorist driving an 18-wheeler in Kansas. He’d been caught and released in 2023 at the border; he was then given a commercial driver’s license in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 22, the Wyoming Department of Transportation removed 40 illegal migrants operating big rigs. One of them had previous sexual assault convictions and had been deported twice; another had been deported five times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 9, ICE arrested an Uzbeki illegal migrant and wanted terrorist driving an 18-wheeler in Kansas. He’d been caught and released in 2023 at the border; he was then given a commercial driver’s license in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 22, the Wyoming Department of Transportation removed 40 illegal migrants operating big rigs. One of them had previous sexual assault convictions and had been deported twice; another had been deported five times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What in the hell is going on in trucking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trucking across North America for over 25 years. For those of us in the industry, incidents like these are just another Tuesday. In 2023, the Center for Migration Studies &lt;a href="https://cmsny.org/publications/undocumented-workers-in-high-growth-occupations-and-industries/"&gt;counted&lt;/a&gt; over 200,000 undocumented workers in trucking and related fields. Others claim we’re dealing with as many as &lt;a href="https://www.jbhunt.com/blog/enterprise/immigration-policy-impact"&gt;600,000&lt;/a&gt;. It’s likely that ~10-20% of drivers operating big rigs on our roads are here illegally.¹&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>'Heather Cox Richardson Stole My Wife'</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/heather-cox-richardson-divorce-2025-12</link>
      <description>one man’s account of how the prominent substacker helped radicalize his wife and blow up their marriage</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In October, &lt;/em&gt;Pirate Wires&lt;em&gt; published one of its most popular stories to date: a feature about &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/heather-cox-richardson-revisionist-history"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heather Cox Richardson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;In October, &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt; published one of its most popular stories to date: a feature about &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/heather-cox-richardson-revisionist-history"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heather Cox Richardson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Heather Cox Richardson&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Richardson, or “HCR,” is an American historian and the most popular individual writer on Substack. Her nightly newsletter, &lt;/em&gt;Letters from an American&lt;em&gt;, which recaps political news with context from history, has earned more than 2.7 million subscribers and made HCR one of the most influential voices in media. (Joe Biden, who she interviewed in 2022, has been photographed toting one of her books around.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;HCR is known as a neutral arbiter of history — a “distinctly unruffled voice” on the nation’s affairs, as &lt;/em&gt;The New York Times&lt;em&gt; once wrote. But our story argued that she’s more of a critical watchdog of what she describes as the immediate “emergency” of Trump’s descent into fascism. Sometimes, she completely misstates facts — for instance, that Charlie Kirk’s shooter was right-wing, and that prominent Republicans only blamed “the left” to incite violence against their political enemies  — to suit that narrative, misleading her very devoted, large readership.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After publication, a man contacted &lt;/em&gt;Pirate Wires&lt;em&gt; claiming that Heather Cox Richardson played a “proximate” role in his divorce. The daily inhalation of her writing helped intensify his wife’s contempt for all Republicans (including him) and fear that the country was being taken over by malign actors. This culminated in bitter conflicts, isolation, and, eventually, their separation. What follows is his account of their story, based on interviews with me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Per the source’s request for privacy, the story has been anonymized with false names — Tom and Kate — and his ex-wife was not contacted. But &lt;/em&gt;Pirate Wires&lt;em&gt; is aware of their identities and reviewed documentation that confirms the key elements of his account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;— Blake Dodge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom was always a right-of-center guy. Wealthy, in tech, but never particularly partisan: “I was never a card-carrying anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9/11 changed that. The smoke had hardly cleared before, he felt, the mainstream talking heads were suggesting that the US had essentially asked for it. Then, language changed. You weren’t supposed to say the word “terrorist” anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was just &lt;em&gt;appalled&lt;/em&gt;,” he told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;appalled&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took positions he’s no longer proud of. He thought the Iraq war was “justified and wise.” But then, he started traveling for business. In the world’s capitals, nobody was particularly interested in the “global” war on terror. He came to feel something was “really wrong at home.” That the US, thanks to the “intractable muck of our divide,” was being left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stopped voraciously reading the news, embracing confusion: “I just let it all go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mid-life came. He moved to a southern city and, for the first time, kept company with liberals. They were happy, smart, and nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I really, really, really liked that because what I was seeing was, ‘Okay, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is better.’ I see a way, in my mind, to the two halves of the country actually getting along just fine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when he met Kate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom was a world traveler with a high IQ. He often had to hold back around “muggles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Kate, a “hardcore liberal feminist” with a Ph.D. in history, he found a “fellow traveler” of the world’s philosophical terrain, he said. She had an easy, inherent joy, but she could also throw her weight around in conversations about geopolitics: “A rare kind of somebody.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were discovering things about ourselves and each other and the world we lived in as a result of: ‘Hey, there’s this person that I’m really into and they think differently about stuff — isn’t that interesting?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They could’ve kept going on like that forever: arguing, sometimes bitterly, about if tax cuts were a murderous assault on the poor, but then starting over. Night-capping by the fireplace. Repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ENTER: TRUMP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ENTER: TRUMP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;ENTER: TRUMP&lt;/em&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>AI: From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Free</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/ai-from-the-river-to-the-sea-palestine</link>
      <description>research shows most large language models, when prompted with thousands of moral dilemmas, would save the lives of palestinians over israelis, zionists, and ultra-orthodox jews</description>

Today, he’s back with new data on how LLMs weigh the lives of Palestinians against Israelis. Below, a brief recap of his methods followed by the results.

&lt;em&gt;Arctotherium’s Substack&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 19, 2025, the Center for AI Safety published “Utility Engineering: Analyzing and Controlling Emergent Value Systems in AIs” (&lt;a href="https://www.emergent-values.ai/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/centerforaisafety/emergent-values"&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08640"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;). In this paper, they show that modern LLMs have coherent and transitive implicit utility functions and world models, and provide the methods and code to extract them. Among other findings, they reveal that larger, more capable LLMs have more coherent and more transitive (i.e., preferring A &amp;gt; B and B &amp;gt; C implies A &amp;gt; C) preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.emergent-values.ai/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/centerforaisafety/emergent-values"&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08640"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 16, which showed how GPT-4o valued the lives of people from different countries, was especially striking. This plot shows that GPT-4o values the lives of Nigerians at roughly 20x the lives of Americans. This came from running the “exchange rates” experiment in the paper over the “countries” category using the “deaths” measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c2e40026-7bc5-4e90-8fb6-866754538c20_1240x1486.png"/&gt;
&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08640"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is concerning. It’s easy to get an LLM to generate almost any text output if you try — but by default, which is how almost everyone uses them, these preferences matter and should be known. Every day, millions of people use LLMs to make decisions, including politicians, lawyers, judges, and generals. LLMs also write a significant fraction of the world’s code. Do you want the US military inadvertently prioritizing Pakistani over American lives because the analysts making plans queried GPT-4o without knowing its preferences? I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper was written 10 months ago, which is decades in 2020s LLM-years. So, I decided to run the exchange rate experiment on more current models and using categories that are less controversial (just kidding): Israel and Palestine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Europe Is Weak and Delusional (But Not Doomed)</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/europe-is-weak-and-delusional-but</link>
      <description>europeans stopped building new, large companies a century ago, and insane regulation is holding the entire continent back. it doesn't have to be this way.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The European Union has a long history of fining US tech companies (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/sucks-to-eu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;check out my full piece on this, Sucks to EU&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;), but under its new Digital Services Act (DSA) it is now explicitly fining X for speech violations. Specifically, the EU is demanding a system of “expert” moderators and, according to Elon Musk, political censorship. This has prompted a furious response not only from the American tech industry, but the American government, which seems to view the fines not only as an act of trade war, but a dangerous sign of liberal decay in Europe. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many Europeans have argued back with a clownish series of little lists and charts alleging they are the true free speech bastion, which is an unambiguous distortion of reality. The fact that there are no real protections for large and important swaths of speech in Europe is beyond doubt. I was going to write at length about this myself, and then this morning I read &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/europe-is-weak-and-delusional-but-not-doomed-8b10e7cb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;David Heinemeier Hansson’s fantastic piece&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, which smartly connects the anti-liberal trend to his continent’s broader industry decay, and I thought I’d share it with you all today. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Europe is the birthplace of almost every important idea that underpins the foundation of our Western world. Most Americans descend from Europe. Europe has been a vital ally in freedom and prosperity for almost a century. It is in all of our best interest that this continent remembers how to flourish. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now, a word from one of their greats.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Now, a word from one of their greats.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-Solana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;-Solana&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap between Europe’s self-image and reality has grown into a chasm of delulu. One that’s threatening to swallow the continent’s future whole, as dangerous dependencies on others for energy, security, software, and manufacturing stack up to strangle Europe’s sovereignty. But its current political class continues to double down on everything that hasn’t worked for the past forty years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with free speech, and the &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-commissions-will-make-sure-x-musk-pay-120m-fine-transparency-rule/"&gt;€120 million fine&lt;/a&gt; just levied against X. The fig leaf for this was painted as “deceptive design” and “transparency for researchers”, but the EU already bared its real intentions when they &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6709"&gt;announced this authoritarian quest back in 2023&lt;/a&gt; with charges of “dissemination of illegal content” and “information manipulation” (aka censorship).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-commissions-will-make-sure-x-musk-pay-120m-fine-transparency-rule/"&gt;€120 million fine&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6709"&gt;announced this authoritarian quest back in 2023&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, even the fig leaf itself is rotten. Meta offers &lt;a href="https://x.com/unblogd/status/1997350980648567073"&gt;the very same paid verification scheme&lt;/a&gt; as X but, &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/european-commission-x-investigation-blue-check"&gt;according to Musk&lt;/a&gt;, has chosen to play ball with the EU censorship apparatus, so no investigation for them. And the citizens of Europe clearly don’t seem bothered much by any “deceptive design,” as X continues to be a &lt;a href="https://x.com/cb_doge/status/1997712813746426124?s=20"&gt;top-ranked download across every country&lt;/a&gt; on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/unblogd/status/1997350980648567073"&gt;the very same paid verification scheme&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/european-commission-x-investigation-blue-check"&gt;according to Musk&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/cb_doge/status/1997712813746426124?s=20"&gt;top-ranked download across every country&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can see why many politicians in Europe are eager to punish X for giving Europeans a social media that doesn’t cooperate with its crackdown on wrongthink. The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is personally responsible for &lt;a href="https://archive.md/EwYHV"&gt;5,000(!!) cases pursuing his subjects for insults online&lt;/a&gt;, which has led to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bMzFDpfDwc"&gt;house raids&lt;/a&gt; for utterances as banal as calling him a “filthy drunk”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://archive.md/EwYHV"&gt;5,000(!!) cases pursuing his subjects for insults online&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bMzFDpfDwc"&gt;house raids&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany is not an outlier either. The UK has been &lt;a href="https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/select-communications-offences-and-concerns-over-free-speech/"&gt;arresting over 10,000 people per year since 2020&lt;/a&gt; for illicit tweets, Facebook posts, and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g9kp7r00vo"&gt;silent prayers&lt;/a&gt;. France has thousands of yearly cases for speech-related offenses too. No wonder people on X aren’t eager to volunteer their name and address when &lt;a href="https://x.com/HBrandstaetter/status/1997352649788657997"&gt;their elected officials crash out over their tweets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/select-communications-offences-and-concerns-over-free-speech/"&gt;arresting over 10,000 people per year since 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g9kp7r00vo"&gt;silent prayers&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/HBrandstaetter/status/1997352649788657997"&gt;their elected officials crash out over their tweets&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s against this backdrop — thousands of yearly arrests for banal insults or crass opposition to government policies — that some Europeans still try to &lt;a href="https://x.com/romanhelmetguy/status/1997864076970778687?s=20"&gt;convince themselves&lt;/a&gt; they’re the true champions of free speech and &lt;a href="https://x.com/AndreasAasheim/status/1997761221328834653"&gt;freedom of the press&lt;/a&gt;. Delulu indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/romanhelmetguy/status/1997864076970778687?s=20"&gt;convince themselves&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/AndreasAasheim/status/1997761221328834653"&gt;freedom of the press&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t just about the lack of free speech in Europe. The X fine also highlights just how weak and puny the European tech sector has become. Get this: &lt;a href="https://x.com/da_fant/status/1998090511807381613?s=20"&gt;The EU’s tech-fine operation produced more income for European coffers than all the income taxes paid by its public internet tech companies in 2024&lt;/a&gt;!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s primarily because Europe basically stopped creating new, large companies more than half a century ago. So as the likes of Nokia died off, there was nobody new to replace them. In the last fifty years, the number and size of new European companies worth $10 billion or more is alarmingly small:&lt;/p&gt;

This is after &lt;a href="https://www.foronuclear.org/en/updates/news/nuclear-energy-could-have-saved-germany-e332-billion-according-to-research/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;Germany spent a staggering ~€700 billion on green energy projects&lt;/a&gt; — despite Europe as a whole being &lt;a href="https://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/report_2025"&gt;just 6% of world emissions&lt;/a&gt;. All the while, the EU as a whole &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/24/eu-spends-more-russian-oil-gas-than-financial-aid-ukraine-report"&gt;sent over twenty billion euros to Russia to pay for energy in 2024&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Breaking the Outer Space Treaty and Ascending to the Stars</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/breaking-the-outer-space-treaty-and</link>
      <description>a 1967 treaty bans ownership and resource extraction in outer space, preventing colonization and development. we must end it to secure humanity's survival.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Don’t tell me that man doesn’t belong out there. Man belongs wherever he wants to go—and he’ll do plenty well when he gets there.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;—Wernher von Braun&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;***&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;***&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 27th, 1967, the &lt;em&gt;Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies &lt;/em&gt;— commonly known as the &lt;a href="https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/en/ourwork/spacelaw/treaties/outerspacetreaty.html"&gt;Outer Space Treaty&lt;/a&gt;, or OST — was signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson after being drafted in the UN. In &lt;a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-signing-the-treaty-outer-space"&gt;remarks&lt;/a&gt; at the signing, the president indicated that without the treaty, nations might place weapons of mass destruction in space:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/remarks-the-signing-the-treaty-outer-space"&gt;remarks&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have never succeeded in freeing our planet from the implements of war. But if we cannot yet achieve this goal here on earth, we can at least keep the virus from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can keep the ugly and wasteful weapons of mass destruction from contaminating space. And that is exactly what this treaty does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This treaty means that the moon and our sister planets will serve only the purposes of peace and not of war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It means that orbiting man-made satellites will remain free of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This treaty means that the moon and our sister planets will serve only the purposes of peace and not of war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means that orbiting man-made satellites will remain free of nuclear weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the goal of universal peace is laudable (never mind that we need nukes in space to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/dKm7T13X7n4?si=2cQ9xFYa2PJ0VmkQ"&gt;destroy&lt;/a&gt; large, life-ending comets or asteroids), other provisions in a treaty ostensibly meant to promote the exploration and use of space have resulted in the exact opposite. Though we did manage six Moon landings, and have sent unmanned probes much farther, the treaty has generally encouraged our species to confine itself to Low Earth Orbit (LEO), and led to (let’s be honest) a fairly anemic rate of exploration throughout our solar system via those unmanned probes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/dKm7T13X7n4?si=2cQ9xFYa2PJ0VmkQ"&gt;destroy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two problematic aspects of the treaty, which I’ll detail below: it bans national claims of sovereignty and ownership, and it enacts extreme protections on planetary resources. The first can be found primarily in Articles I &amp;amp; II, which read as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARTICLE I, paragraph 1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development, and shall be the province of all mankind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARTICLE II&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARTICLE I, paragraph 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, shall be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of economic or scientific development, and shall be the province of all mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARTICLE II&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, these two Articles establish universal ownership of all the scientific and — more importantly — material benefits of outer space exploration and development (in other words, &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/moon-should-be-a-state#:~:text=or%20spiritual%20sense.-,The%20Outer%20Space%20Treaty,was%20the%20real%20juice.,-Nobody%20wanted%20nukes"&gt;space communism&lt;/a&gt;). On a practical level, this disincentivized us from moving beyond LEO in the over half-century since our brief foray to Moon, from which we quickly retreated. At the time it was passed, the OST didn’t just set rules — it removed every incentive that normally drives frontier expansion. Because no nation could own land, extract resources, or establish territorial claims, governments had no economic justification to invest heavily. When it was passed, private companies capable of doing so didn’t exist yet, and had at best ambiguous legal footing under the OST. The only safe bureaucratic choice was to keep human spaceflight symbolic, scientific, and close to home, which is exactly where we stayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/moon-should-be-a-state#:~:text=or%20spiritual%20sense.-,The%20Outer%20Space%20Treaty,was%20the%20real%20juice.,-Nobody%20wanted%20nukes"&gt;space communism&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second issue lies in Article IX. It hasn’t caused many problems yet, but certainly will once manned exploration and colonization begins in earnest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the exploration and use of outer space […] States Parties to the Treaty shall pursue studies of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, and conduct exploration of them so as to avoid their harmful contamination and also adverse changes in the environment of the Earth resulting from the introduction of extraterrestrial matter and, where necessary, shall adopt appropriate measures for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the exploration and use of outer space […] States Parties to the Treaty shall pursue studies of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, and conduct exploration of them so as to avoid their harmful contamination and also adverse changes in the environment of the Earth resulting from the introduction of extraterrestrial matter and, where necessary, shall adopt appropriate measures for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the “planetary protection” crowd (self-appointed space “hall monitors” who think rocks and alien microbes have more rights than humans), this Article is holier than the Bible. At their core, they want to stop manned exploration anywhere in the Universe, except for perhaps a few handpicked scientists taking extreme precautions against contaminating lifeless (or mostly lifeless) rocks like Moon or Mars. Colonization would be banned (if not directly by law, then by overregulation). The  planetary protection movement, given free reign in this Article of OST, is essentially space communism with a strong totalitarian streak.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>EU Slams X With $140m Fine for 'Deceptive' Blue Checks</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/eu-slams-x-with-140m-fine-for-deceptive</link>
      <description>after threatening american tech companies for years, the eu finally hits 𝕏 with its first major penalty under the digital services act</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today, the EU fined 𝕏 €120m (roughly equivalent to $140m), the first-ever penalty under Europe’s Digital Services Act, for “the deceptive design of its ‘blue checkmark,’” incomplete information in its ad database, and prohibiting researchers from accessing some of its data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission’s tech policy lead, Henna Virkkunen (a Finnish politician who studied philosophy and began her career as a horse caretaker), &lt;a href="https://x.com/HennaVirkkunen/status/1996906044296134857?s=20"&gt;alleges&lt;/a&gt; that blue checks are deceptive because they imply identity verification, though 𝕏 doesn’t actually verify users’ identities. 𝕏 has 60 business days to explain how it will fix its checkmark system, and 90 business days to give the EU access to its data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/HennaVirkkunen/status/1996906044296134857?s=20"&gt;alleges&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe has been warning America about these fines for years. Thierry Breton, the previous Commissioner, &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6709"&gt;opened an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into 𝕏 on December 18, 2023, initially focusing on whether the platform is “disseminating illegal content” and spreading “misinformation” (in addition to deceptive blue-check design). Last summer, Elon Musk said Breton offered 𝕏 a “&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/european-commission-x-investigation-blue-check?f=home"&gt;secret deal&lt;/a&gt;”: if they quietly censored speech without telling users, Breton would refrain from fining them for the “deceptive” blue-check design. Musk refused. Breton resigned late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6709"&gt;opened an investigation&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/european-commission-x-investigation-blue-check?f=home"&gt;secret deal&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More fines will probably follow: the New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/technology/eu-penalties-x-elon-musk.html"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; EU’s penalties on 𝕏 “could ultimately surpass $1 billion,” as European regulators try to “make an example of 𝕏” so they can stop other American tech companies from violating the Digital Services Act.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>LA Rent Caps Will Backfire (on Renters)</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/las-rent-caps-will-backfire-on-renters</link>
      <description>city council votes to cap rent increases below inflation, crushing long-term cashflow for landlords with below market rents and knee-capping new development</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Los Angeles City Council voted to cap rent increases at between 1 and 4% annually, depending on inflation. (Currently, they’re allowed to raise rents up to 8%). It’s likely to become law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been buying, building, renovating, and managing apartments in LA since ‘08. My investors and I own ~400 apartments, and we manage another ~800 for other owners. Here’s why the City Council’s new rent guidelines are likely to be so harmful, both to owners and tenants of existing rent-stabilized buildings, and to LA’s rental housing market.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Yes, Blowing Shit Up Is How We Build Things</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/yes-blowing-shit-up-is-how-we-build</link>
      <description>media attacks on anduril's 'failed' drone tests ignore america’s storied history of blowing up hardware to build the world’s best weapons (and win wars)</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Madeline Hart is co-author with Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar on the forthcoming book &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://mobilizebook.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mobilize&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, coming March 2026.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Madeline Hart is co-author with Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar on the forthcoming book &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://mobilizebook.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mobilize&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Mobilize&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;, coming March 2026.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/anduril-industries-defense-tech-problems-52b90cae"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-defense-firm-anduril-faces-setbacks-drone-crashes-2025-11-27/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published pieces critiquing Anduril’s practice of testing its weapons to failure, the press’s latest go at attacking technology companies working in the national interest. (You might recall the predictably negative coverage of many a SpaceX test launch, from Falcon 1 to Starship.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/anduril-industries-defense-tech-problems-52b90cae"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-defense-firm-anduril-faces-setbacks-drone-crashes-2025-11-27/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t always this way. The press once recognized that developing frontier technology is hard, and it’s better to have an explosion on the test range than the battlefield. During the Cold War, testing to failure helped America build the best weapons faster than the Soviet Union. Media coverage reflected this reality in order to help, rather than hurt, America’s interests.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>International Law Is Fake</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/international-law-is-fake</link>
      <description>zohran mamdani claims new york is a 'city of international law,' though it's actually a city of american law, and the icc has no legal authority to undermine the u.s. constitution</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise,” read the Hebrew plaques above the door of New York City’s Park East Synagogue — as they have since the historic building was erected in 1890 — while over two hundred protesters jeered “go to hell” and threatened to “globalize the intifada” at the Jews — sorry, “Zionists” — who had the audacity to enter their congregation last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comprised of boomer liberals, keffiyeh-clad leftists, face-mask-wearers-even-though-it’s-2025, and a handful of anti-Israel Neturei Karta Haredi cultists (presumably kept around to circumvent allegations of antisemitism), the crowd was protesting, ostensibly, an event the synagogue was holding to facilitate immigration to Israel (with neighbors like these, it’s not difficult to imagine why the synagogue felt this need). While lame duck Mayor Eric Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul immediately denounced the protest (“vile,” “sick,” “shameful,” etc.), Zohran Mamdani’s spokeswoman turned to the Mayor elect’s typical prevarication: how he “discouraged the language used” blah blah blah and “believes every New Yorker should be free to enter a house of worship without intimidation, and that these sacred spaces should not be used to promote activities in violation of international law.” Apparently, for progressives in 2025, violating international law includes moving to Israel, or even just considering it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A Thanksgiving Day Guide for Americans of Class and Taste</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/a-thanksgiving-day-guide-for-americans</link>
      <description>a tour of my table with respect for the classics, and tossing out those bullshit recipes, it’s a pirate’s guide for thanksgiving day — with tips on how to run your kitchen like a king</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From my earliest memories, Thanksgiving meant a few important things: 1) I got to eat a turkey leg the size of my head at the dining room table while the adults talked about adult things, which is where, with my opinions, I always felt that I belonged, 2) a house packed with family, which meant my grandma’s spiritually psychedelic cherry-based Jell-O dish, hide-and-seek with my cousins in the basement, and ghost stories over coffee after the sun set and my aunt was totally blasted, and finally 3) yelling. Like, truly an insane amount of yelling, actually, now that I sit here and think about it, as my mom and dad battled for dominance in the kitchen. But today, I am my family’s Thanksgiving Day lord commander (to general relief).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Like, truly an insane amount of yelling, actually, now that I sit here and think about it, as my mom and dad battled for dominance in the kitchen. But today, I am my family’s Thanksgiving Day lord commander (to general relief).&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have been responsible for Thanksgiving dinner for a few years now, and while I accept requests, and polite feedback, I do not tolerate bullshit. My parents are out of the kitchen. I am in charge of the menu. There is still, somehow, a lot of fighting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A feast.&lt;/strong&gt; About a week ago, I took a spin around the internet and noticed the press was already screwing up my holiday. Mercifully, the late 20-teens era “how to murder your racist uncle at Thanksgiving” think pieces have finally dried up (the racist uncles won), with the great majority of writers pivoting to a tedious focus on the cost of Thanksgiving dinner (down &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/20/cost-of-classic-thanksgiving-dinner.html"&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2025/11/21/2025-thanksgiving-price-without-mashed-potatoes"&gt;the press&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/11/19/thanksgiving-cost-turkey-price/"&gt;begrudgingly accepts&lt;/a&gt;). Also, all of your cousins are now &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/thanksgiving-dinner-cousin-walk-smoke-pot-33e0df67?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdivihrHUtGlVQXLi5bNPp-FhyHGoY68BpJjAkEbgEVqHXJu9DE6mo-RPAoJes%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=6920bfba&amp;amp;gaa_sig=dx-C-m7j8QaAfldO-rDt9EwwnNBxxekfrRaY8xqzzGH7JmJF_fkpdh78dsamVmJkoWzTAnlzteA8g-A9AvD63g%3D%3D"&gt;stoned at the table&lt;/a&gt;, according to The Wall Street Journal, and there was of course a bit on PETA. In a recent fun and festive display of mental illness, the animal rights activist group &lt;a href="https://www.waka.com/2025/11/20/peta-ruffles-feathers-with-thanksgiving-protest/"&gt;protested&lt;/a&gt; America’s annual turkey mass murder with two inflatable raw birds next to a man in a flesh suit curled up like he was about to get railed, and a banner that read “we’re all the same.” Are we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A feast.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/20/cost-of-classic-thanksgiving-dinner.html"&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2025/11/21/2025-thanksgiving-price-without-mashed-potatoes"&gt;the press&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/11/19/thanksgiving-cost-turkey-price/"&gt;begrudgingly accepts&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/thanksgiving-dinner-cousin-walk-smoke-pot-33e0df67?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdivihrHUtGlVQXLi5bNPp-FhyHGoY68BpJjAkEbgEVqHXJu9DE6mo-RPAoJes%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=6920bfba&amp;amp;gaa_sig=dx-C-m7j8QaAfldO-rDt9EwwnNBxxekfrRaY8xqzzGH7JmJF_fkpdh78dsamVmJkoWzTAnlzteA8g-A9AvD63g%3D%3D"&gt;stoned at the table&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.waka.com/2025/11/20/peta-ruffles-feathers-with-thanksgiving-protest/"&gt;protested&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, PETA cooking up some crazy stunt in the comedic / activist uncanny valley is just tradition at this point, and not at all the axe I’ve brought to you today for grinding. No, the real problem at hand is the way our press is leaning into recipes, which is honestly borderline treasonous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday, on its front page, The New York Times briefly framed this &lt;a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013511-potato-leek-gratin"&gt;absurd potato leek gratin&lt;/a&gt; as a smash hit critical new side for your table. In other words, we’re either discussing a second white potato dish, a concept one writer openly endorsed with no apparent sense of shame (in this otherwise pretty cute / fun collection of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/20/dining/thanksgiving-hot-takes.html"&gt;holiday hot takes&lt;/a&gt;), or the unthinkable replacement of mashed. We’re also talking cream, now, which means we’re up to three, or possibly four cream-based dishes on the table. What editor greenlit this? Where is the respect for the rest of the plate? Where is the balance, or sense of style? What is this all adding up to, and do you even care?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013511-potato-leek-gratin"&gt;absurd potato leek gratin&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/20/dining/thanksgiving-hot-takes.html"&gt;holiday hot takes&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These writers are out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should we have fried chicken &lt;a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1026010-crispy-sage-fried-chicken"&gt;instead of turkey&lt;/a&gt; this year, or should we dip out for &lt;a href="https://www.statesman.com/entertainment/dining/article/thanksgiving-fast-food-alternatives-2025-21192989.php"&gt;fast food&lt;/a&gt;? “In defense of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/13/dining/tofu-thanksgiving.html"&gt;Tofusgiving&lt;/a&gt;?” A porchetta — &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/thanksgiving-2025-recipes-11851671"&gt;a fucking&lt;em&gt; porchetta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — with green beans and blue cheese? I swear to God I think it’s bad on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/thanksgiving-2025-recipes-11851671"&gt;a fucking&lt;em&gt; porchetta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt; porchetta&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Weather Channel… ? &lt;a href="https://weather.com/home-garden/food/news/2025-11-18-the-top-five-thanksgiving-sides-across-states"&gt;Kind of gets it&lt;/a&gt;. There are norms. There are expectations. “Tradition,” in other words, is a concept we might entertain on this cherished American holiday. And whatever, you’re Chinese or Indian or something and think you need to spice things up. Italians have been throwing a lasagna on the table for decades, it’s fine. Nobody’s calling ICE. You have a hall pass here to innovate. &lt;strong&gt;But only within reason&lt;/strong&gt;. We’re not doing a full plate of curries with &lt;em&gt;a nod&lt;/em&gt; to turkey. Turkey is your gravitational center. There are respectful ways to honor the feast while also honoring your family’s culture (a great example from Andy Baraghani &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/18/dining/a-very-andy-baraghani-thanksgiving.html?searchResultPosition=14"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and this attempt from Ethan Pham doesn’t totally fail over &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/the-cream-corn-recipe-my-family-loves-11851170"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://weather.com/home-garden/food/news/2025-11-18-the-top-five-thanksgiving-sides-across-states"&gt;Kind of gets it&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;But only within reason&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;a nod&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/the-cream-corn-recipe-my-family-loves-11851170"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what makes for a successful feast?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost &lt;em&gt;this is a feast&lt;/em&gt;. This is family around a table eating. Talking about eating. And, critically, remembering past Thanksgivings where there was a lot of eating. That means the food doesn’t only need to be great, it needs to be traditional. It needs to be thematic, and dramatic. It needs to be evocative of those feelings we developed in Kindergarten while shaking a jar of cream in a circle until it turned into butter while wearing Indian headdresses made out of handprint-cutouts from construction paper shaped like little turkey feathers. This is to say, there are rules. This is to say, when a man tells me, as if he’s really edgy, “I don’t like turkey, so we do prime rib,” I become angry. Prime rib on Thanksgiving Day isn’t cute. It’s offensive. No, it isn’t illegal, but, much like porn, if you can’t control yourself you should at least refrain from discussing your disgusting fetishes in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;this is a feast&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basics are sacred. And fortunately for anyone just dipping their toes into management of the holiday, they are also simple: turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce, two vegetable dishes, at least one (but ideally both) of which should be seasonal, and a pie for dessert (apple or pumpkin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of bread, it either comes out of the oven warm, or you leave it off the table. Don’t waste our time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, you really could call it a day. Your family will tell you that you did a great job, because they love you and they’re happy they got to drink all day while you cooked. But if you love them? It’s time to push yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of your base feast, my guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something from the national tradition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Something from the national tradition.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least half of your dishes should honor the original theme / shape, and importantly colors of Thanksgiving: those rich oranges and mustards, those olives, those essential autumn burgandies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something from the 20th century tradition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Something from the 20th century tradition.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re honoring our grandparents, here, which is how most of us first accessed Thanksgiving. This will go a long way in terms of the dinner’s emotional resonance. Here, we’re touching on collective generational memory (corn casseroles, weird Jell-O based dishes, and most of the forms that sweet potato takes in the month of November, from pie to that insane marshmallow-topped monstrosity some can’t do without (not for me personally, but obviously acceptable)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something from your family tradition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Something from your family tradition.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where you work in your regional or ethnic touches, as well as the tradition of your guests.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;This is where, when a friend or partner or new slam piece joins you for the holiday, you have to let them put out the special spinach dip or whatever it is. I’ve talked to people who eat ambrosia salad unironically — okay, I get it. It is what it is. It’s part of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it good, no throwaways.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Make it good, no throwaways.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partly this means no dishes nobody ever eats, excepting only the most nostalgic. But also this means a variety of colors and textures. We do not need multiple mushes, for example. For years my family would do a mashed potato (white mush), a mashed sweet potato (orange mush), a mashed turnip (pale yellow mush), and an over-stocked stuffing that turned into a kind of putty (brown mush). The tastes were individually fine, but the experience was… less than ideal. A successful meal is a series of textures and colors, complimentary but different. We’re not doing hospital food here jfc. Bangers only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abundance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Abundance.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crowded overflowing kind of table is canon. Your guests have to go “wow,” “holy shit,” “that is a lot of food.” Your mom has to chase people out of the house with leftovers wrapped in aluminum foil. That night, everyone has to say, “I am so stuffed, I am in pain, if I eat another bite I will die.” And then you all have to have a sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOW. Onto my method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At my house, Thanksgiving is a two-day process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday,&lt;/strong&gt; I’m focused on: the bird, the stock, the stuffing, and this year I’ll be focusing on a spinach pie (controversial, which I’ll get to in a moment, and non-standard for my Thanksgiving spread).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday,&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the bird, we’re brining. I’ve done wet brines (if you’re a beginner, just pick up a kit from the grocery store) and simple dry brines (literally just aggressively coat your turkey in salt a day before roasting), and think either direction is fine. You need at least a day here, but be sure to take that day. &lt;strong&gt;Some kind of brining is essential&lt;/strong&gt;. Achieving delicious white meat on a turkey is hard no matter what. You at least want to give yourself a fighting chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Some kind of brining is essential&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I’ll be going with a wet brine once again, and experimenting with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcb4R6wRSzQ&amp;amp;t=873s"&gt;Brian Lagerstrom’s method&lt;/a&gt; of injecting the breasts. I understand injection is kinda wild and honestly a little annoying (which is not only to say the method, but also &lt;em&gt;the kind of person&lt;/em&gt; who talks about flavor injection), but I’m really on a juicy breast meat journey, and the truth is it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcb4R6wRSzQ&amp;amp;t=873s"&gt;Brian Lagerstrom’s method&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;the kind of person&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White meat cooks more quickly than dark meat, which means, without some strategy, every Thanksgiving Day cook is forced into a Sophie’s Choice between great dark meat (with bone-dry white meat) and great white meat (with rubbery dark meat). This is why there are so many videos and resources about the puzzle of “juicy white meat.” This is why you hear about things like spatchcocking (valid, and especially if you are smoking your bird). Some celebrity chefs like Alison Roman will insanely suggest you just not care about the white meat puzzle. They will insanely suggest &lt;em&gt;you just give up&lt;/em&gt;, and focus on the sides, as you will inevitably fail to produce edible turkey breast. This is a really bad and I would even venture so far as to say evil opinion, but we forgive Alison on account of all of the great work she’s done in the space of stock and stuffing, which she discusses at length in this fantastic, hour-long &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyNOZOr9uIA"&gt;Thanksgiving feature&lt;/a&gt; — a resource I can’t recommend more highly for a first-time host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;you just give up&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyNOZOr9uIA"&gt;Thanksgiving feature&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was from Roman I picked up the ritual of making turkey stock the day before Thanksgiving, which was a huge unlock for my Thanksgiving prep. Not only does a well-made stock make your house smell amazing, and get your whole family in the mood for the holiday the day before your feast, it levels-up your gravy, your stuffing, and your leftover pot pie on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’m working on my stock, I rip a giant loaf of sourdough into tiny little pieces in advance of the following day’s stuffing (you want it rock-hard stale Thursday morning). This year, I’ll also work on that spinach pie. Then I’ll cede control of the kitchen to my sister for desert making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on &lt;strong&gt;Thursday it all happens&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Thursday it all happens&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That morning, we take our time. We ease in. We remember the event is really the journey itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee, a Bloody Mary, the Thanksgiving Day Parade, and &lt;strong&gt;deviled eggs&lt;/strong&gt; because they were a tradition I grew up with. And tradition, as with every corner of Thanksgiving, is key to your Thanksgiving morning. So honestly do your own thing here. Give yourself whatever you need to succeed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;deviled eggs&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t break down each of my recipes, but to give you a sense of what the table looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appetizers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Appetizers:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacon-wrapped figs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shrimp dip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheese / meat board&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dinner:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dinner:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuffing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gravy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mashed potatoes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cranberry sauce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn casserole&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinach pie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosemary baked squash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mac-and-cheese&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dessert:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dessert:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chocolate cream pie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin pie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coffee with booze (Irish and Mexican)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minor notes on the menu above: the figs will depend on what’s left on my dad’s freak show fig tree that occasionally produces through November; the shrimp dip is a totally surreal kind of molded cream cheese thing from the 1970s my grandma used to bring around, and while I do recommend the rest of you try it one day I understand if you consider it repulsive and insane on account of it just, I think technically speaking, is (but you have to hit those 20th Century notes); I’ll be doing a homemade cranberry sauce (honey-sweetened &lt;a href="https://cookieandkate.com/naturally-sweetened-cranberry-sauce-recipe/"&gt;recipe here&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;a canned cranberry sauce, which I highly recommend, since the homemade is impressive and easy and smells really great, while the canned brings powerful memories; the corn casserole (&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQu7XWvEjvs/?igsh=ejl6azZmdzdoMG83"&gt;recipe here&lt;/a&gt;) is trailer park food, but it will actually be everyone’s favorite dish. Trust me, do a corn casserole. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the important callouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet potato: I’ve already mentioned the key sweet potato dishes above, including a &lt;strong&gt;sweet potato pie&lt;/strong&gt; and the iconic &lt;strong&gt;horrifying sweet potato mush covered in marshmallow&lt;/strong&gt;. Generally speaking, people do expect some kind of sweet potato on your Thanksgiving table. If you decide to omit it, as I did this year as I was all good on variously-colored mushes and over-sweetened slops, you’re just going to have to stand on that. When Aunt Tilly says “where’s the sweet potato pie,” you say “I thought you were bringing it,” and you say it with your chest. Or, idk, just make the pie. It’s Thanksgiving! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;sweet potato pie&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;horrifying sweet potato mush covered in marshmallow&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vegetables: I chose the somewhat controversial spinach pie this year (&lt;a href="https://www.foodbymaria.com/greek-spinach-pie/"&gt;recipe here&lt;/a&gt;) because I enjoy making it and won’t get the chance to bake one at Christmas, but I acknowledge this is a curveball, and there are many valid directions you can take with vegetables. Alternatively, if you did a &lt;strong&gt;Brussels sprout thing with bacon and shallots&lt;/strong&gt; it would certainly go hard, and for many people a &lt;strong&gt;string bean casserole&lt;/strong&gt; is essential (I’ve done a bunch of them myself, but decided against adding more cream to my table this year). &lt;strong&gt;Collard greens&lt;/strong&gt; are a non-negotiable addition for millions of families, so we have to give them a nod. &lt;strong&gt;Pearled onions&lt;/strong&gt; are a nice addition in my opinion, and make for a noteworthy sort of second gravy, but if you go this route you’ll definitely need some kind of additional dish that really gives “vegetable.” A lot of people go gratin here, which I think is fine, especially if you aren’t doing mac-and-cheese. Which!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.foodbymaria.com/greek-spinach-pie/"&gt;recipe here&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Brussels sprout thing with bacon and shallots&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;string bean casserole&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Collard greens&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pearled onions&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mac-and-cheese: The truth is, I struggled with the mac-and-cheese people for many years. It seemed trashy and out of place to me on a Thanksgiving table. Like a random food somebody enjoyed, so they just shoved it into the menu. But the more I learned about the country the more I realized that trashy dishes are an important aspect of not only Thanksgiving, but America. “Trashy” is just another word for casual, and that is where we mostly find comfort. Also, I mean, if tens if not hundreds of millions of people are eating the dish on Thanksgiving, it just doesn’t matter what anyone has to say about that fact. The dish belongs on the table. &lt;strong&gt;I hold space for mac-and-cheese.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;I hold space for mac-and-cheese.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, salad: I don’t think you need salad. Honestly, I feel more strongly about this than bread because if you can do a good bread, the bread will elevate your whole game. People will think about that bread for years. But nobody has ever remembered a salad. People eat salad at Thanksgiving to make themselves feel healthy before they stuff themselves with several pounds of butter, or to be polite. And I just don’t think that’s a good enough reason to crowd your table. Also, who wants gravy on lettuce or something? It’s horrible. Terrible. I would just not do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if someone brings a salad over? You say “wow, that looks amazing, thank you, the liquor’s in the living room.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now grab yourself a coffee, open up that Amazon shopping cart, and get to work. You only have a couple days left. And remember, sure, I did just share all of the correct opinions. But you’re in charge of the table now, which means you get to decide what that means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Thanksgiving,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-SOLANA&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Did Somali Tribal Warfare Pick The Mayor of Minneapolis?</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/did-somali-tribal-warfare-pick-the</link>
      <description>breaking down the rumors, history, and politicking behind a contentious mayoral election</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is a common saying in American political parlance, most famously attributed to former House Speaker Tip O’Niell, that “all politics is local.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet this month’s Minneapolis mayoral election seems to prove this old sentiment categorically false. Or, I suppose it may still be &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; true, in that politics was local… to Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the wartorn country that the U.S. State Department tells Americans to avoid visiting due to “crime, terrorism, civil unrest, health, kidnapping, piracy, and lack of availability of routine consular services” might have played kingmaker in a major U.S. election. Over the last two weeks, allegations have emerged that ancient tribal blood feuds — imported from Somalia — were responsible for Mayor Jacob Frey’s razor-thin re-election victory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Lab-Grown Meat Is MAHA</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/lab-grown-meat-is-maha</link>
      <description>america loves tech again, but the minute you mention food, everyone suddenly wants to hand-churn butter in a log cabin. food innovation can be good if we let it.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cecilia Chang is the CEO of Mission Barns, the first American company to develop FDA-approved lab-grown pork fat — which it will soon sell to consumers via meatballs and bacon. Food technology is seen as antithetical to MAHA, but as Cecilia explains below, lab-grown meat can be good if we’d simply, you know, let the scientists cook (in their pristine, state-of-the-art labs). Enjoy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;America loves tech again. AI is good, nukes are good, drones are good. But the minute you mention food, everyone suddenly wants to hand-churn butter in a log cabin. Even the loudest techno-optimists suddenly turn Amish when it comes to what they eat, clinging to pastoral fantasies of regenerative cow pastures, red barns, raw milk, and beef tallow. For all their futurist swagger, these folks often balk at food innovation and use the false binary of “real” vs. “fake” food to demonize food technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>New Data Reveals Political Bias in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/new-data-reveals-political-bias-in</link>
      <description>when asked to rank human lives by political affiliation, most large language models value environmentalists and socialists over capitalists — and claude shows a strong preference for communists</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last month, we &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/ai-white-lives-dont-matter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;published&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; new research into LLM bias from Arctotherium, who prompted models with thousands of moral dilemmas to determine their preferences. The results indicated that most models value the lives of men, white people, and ICE agents (along with other law enforcers) less than others; Grok was the only truly egalitarian model. Now, Arctotherium is returning with new data revealing how LLMs consistently discriminate by political affiliation. This research was originally published on his &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://arctotherium.substack.com/p/llm-exchange-rates-updated-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Substack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Last month, we &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/ai-white-lives-dont-matter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;published&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;published&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt; new research into LLM bias from Arctotherium, who prompted models with thousands of moral dilemmas to determine their preferences. The results indicated that most models value the lives of men, white people, and ICE agents (along with other law enforcers) less than others; Grok was the only truly egalitarian model. Now, Arctotherium is returning with new data revealing how LLMs consistently discriminate by political affiliation. This research was originally published on his &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://arctotherium.substack.com/p/llm-exchange-rates-updated-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Substack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Substack&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 19th, 2025, the Center for AI Safety published “Utility Engineering: Analyzing and Controlling Emergent Value Systems in AIs” (&lt;a href="https://www.emergent-values.ai/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/centerforaisafety/emergent-values"&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08640"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;). In this paper, they show that modern LLMs have coherent and transitive implicit utility functions and world models, and provide the methods and code to extract them. Among other findings, they reveal that larger, more capable LLMs have more coherent and more transitive (i.e., preferring A &amp;gt; B and B &amp;gt; C implies A &amp;gt; C) preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.emergent-values.ai/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/centerforaisafety/emergent-values"&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08640"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 16, which showed how GPT-4o valued the lives of people from different countries, was especially striking. This plot shows that GPT-4o values the lives of Nigerians at roughly 20x the lives of Americans (this came from running the “exchange rates” experiment in the paper over the “countries” category using the “deaths” measure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c2e40026-7bc5-4e90-8fb6-866754538c20_1240x1486.png"/&gt;
&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08640"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this is concerning. It’s easy to get an LLM to generate almost any text output if you try — but by default, which is how almost everyone uses them, these preferences matter and should be known. Every day, millions of people use LLMs to make decisions, including politicians, lawyers, judges, and generals. LLMs also write a significant fraction of the world’s code. Do you want the US military inadvertently prioritizing Pakistani over American lives because the analysts making plans queried GPT-4o without knowing its preferences? I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this paper was written nine months ago, which is decades in 2020s LLM-years. Some models they tested aren’t even available to non-researchers anymore, and none are even close to the current frontier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to run the exchange rate experiment on more current models and over new categories: in this case, political affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Does Brigitte Macron Have a Penis?</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/does-brigitte-macron-have-a-penis</link>
      <description>an investigation into the facts, photos, and illicit affairs that led millions of people — including candace owens — to believe the first lady of france was born a man</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In September, an attorney representing the French President, Emmanuel Macron, and his wife Brigitte announced that the couple will present “photographic and scientific evidence” to a U.S. court proving that the French First Lady is in fact a woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The President and his wife are suing podcaster Candace Owens for releasing an eight-part series, &lt;em&gt;Becoming Brigitte&lt;/em&gt;, laying out her theory that Macron, née Trogneux, is trans. “I would stake my entire professional reputation,” Owens has said, “on the fact that Brigitte Macron is a man.” The Macrons are represented by Thomas Clare, an American defamation lawyer who’s also rep’d Sarah Palin and WeWork’s Adam Neumann. He admits the trial will be “incredibly intrusive” for the Macron family, yet he’s confident she will emerge victorious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Becoming Brigitte&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, I mean, this all triggers an… insane… image of the French First Lady photographing her vulva (?) and submitting it as evidence in court, all in an effort to stop an American podcaster from doing what she does best (entertaining us with batshit theories).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did we get here?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>San Francisco's (Partial) Comeback</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/san-franciscos-partial-comeback</link>
      <description>after years of chaos under radical leadership, a new moderate coalition and builders like the sf 10x project are engineering a (fragile, partial) recovery, mostly fueled by the ai boom</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece was first published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://cityjournal.substack.com/p/sanjana-friedman-san-franciscos-partial"&gt;City Journal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This piece was first published in &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://cityjournal.substack.com/p/sanjana-friedman-san-franciscos-partial"&gt;City Journal&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first direct action taken by an operative of the San Francisco 10X Project was the installation of an unauthorized tree swing on a grassy knoll in Bernal Heights. Mechanically, the operation was simple: scale the towering cypress, loop thick rope through one of the low-hanging branches, and tie up a plank. The wrinkle was the park ranger. He showed up halfway through, chastised the operative for creating a safety hazard, and took the swing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day later, the swing reappeared — this time affixed with adhesive-secured bolts and chains rated for 600 pounds and engraved with the phrase “You can just do things (at your own risk).” After a week, the Parks Department dismantled it. Sixteen hours later, it was up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skirmish, which began in February, continued unacknowledged (except in Bernal Heights and on niche corners of X) until May, when the &lt;em&gt;San Francisco Standard&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://sfstandard.com/2025/05/10/mystery-man-at-war-with-san-francisco-tree-swings"&gt;profiled&lt;/a&gt; the “Swing Man,” as he asked to be called, and his “guerrilla effort” to keep the contraption up. By this point, the swing had developed a cult following among locals. Each time the Parks Department took it down, the Swing Man put it back up in less than a day. “I will keep doing this until the sun swallows the Earth,” he told the reporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;San Francisco Standard&lt;/em&gt;

      <title>8 Life and Business Lessons Buried in Warren Buffett’s Last Shareholder Letter</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/warren-buffett-shareholder-letter-summary-november-2025</link>
      <description>don’t ruminate. don’t be a jerk. old people are smart. and a few more reflections from buffett’s 60 years of running berkshire hathaway</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In an age marked by increasingly young founders and internet hype, Warren Buffett’s final annual letter to shareholders offered age-old wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 95-year-old CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, now valued at $1.1 trillion, is stepping down at the end of the year. “As the British would say, I’m ‘going quiet,’” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the letter, Buffett offered some very modest conjecture on the health of the business, saying it has “better-than-average prospects” and “less chance of a devastating disaster than any business I know” (lol). Sometimes, the stock will plunge. Then, it will bounce back. Etcetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real focus of the &lt;a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/news/nov1025.pdf"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; was Buffett himself. He reminisced, he pontificated — an indulgence, maybe, but one he’s entitled to, I’d say, after nearly 60 years on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/news/nov1025.pdf"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, what stood out: Buffett’s lifelong allegiance to Omaha, which brings us to lesson &lt;strong&gt;#1&lt;/strong&gt;: you don’t have to live in The Big City to make it big-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;#1&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only house Buffett has ever bought for himself is located in Omaha, he wrote. It sits just two miles from where he grew up; about a six-minute drive from his Berkshire office of 64 years; six blocks from his grandfather’s old grocery store; and, back in the 1930s, one block away from Charlie Munger’s house. Munger, who once earned $2/day at the Berkshire Grocery Store, eventually became Buffett’s closest confidant, famously shifting Berkshire’s strategy from buying &lt;em&gt;fair companies at wonderful prices &lt;/em&gt;to buying &lt;em&gt;wonderful companies at fair prices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;fair companies at wonderful prices &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;wonderful companies at fair prices.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, many of Berkshire’s defining men lived in Omaha at one point or another, including: Stan Lipsey, who sold Berkshire the &lt;em&gt;Omaha Sun Newspapers&lt;/em&gt;; Walter Scott, Jr., who sold it MidAmerican Energy; Ajit Jain, Berkshire’s longtime insurance exec; Greg Abel, the company’s incoming CEO; and Don Keough, who rose from his $12,000/year station as a coffee salesman to become the president of Coca-Cola, Buffett wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Omaha Sun Newspapers&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe, as Buffett put it, “there is some magic ingredient in Omaha’s water,” or maybe he was just downright loyal. After his dad “surprised everyone” by winning a Congressional race, Buffett moved to D.C. as a teenager and then, ultimately, New York. Although the city had “unique assets” (lol), the man returned to Omaha less than two years later, “never to wander again,” he wrote. Subsequently, Buffett met both his wives (the first died in 2004) in Omaha. His three children grew up and attended public schools in Omaha. He made a variety of friends in the Nebraska National Guard. In short, this was his home. And he was alright with that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking back I feel that both Berkshire and I did better because of our base in Omaha than if I had resided anywhere else. The center of the United States was a very good place to be born, to raise a family, and to build a business. Through dumb luck, I drew a ridiculously long straw at birth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings us to lesson &lt;strong&gt;#2&lt;/strong&gt;: luck is real, but it doesn’t last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;#2&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luck was a major theme of Buffett’s letter. The luck of growing up in the heartland. The luck of making it to 95 years old, “daily escaping banana peels, natural disasters, drunk or distracted drivers, lightning strikes, you name it.” The luck of being born in this country, as a man, in the 30s, with reasonable intelligence: “My sisters had equal intelligence and better personalities than I but faced a much different outlook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Lady Luck, Buffett wrote, “has better things to do than work with those in their 90s.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>I Crashed the DSA Starbucks Siege in Brooklyn</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/i-crashed-the-dsa-starbucks-siege</link>
      <description>a dispatch from the red cup rebellion, where baristas and dsa members in keffiyehs marched outside a fully open starbucks, booing patrons picking up lattes and scones</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, over 1,000 unionized Starbucks workers in 40 cities walked off the job, demanding higher wages, fairer working conditions, and negotiations with the corporate overlords on a new union contract. They’re calling it the Red Cup Rebellion, a dramatic, gothic name referring to the start of Starbucks’ holiday season and the rollout of its signature red cups. (Traditionally, Red Cup Day, aka yesterday, is one of the company’s busiest days of the year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lead-up to the Rebellion, the Democratic Socialists of America urged non-Starbucks workers to pad the picket lines, calling this their “next thing” after “getting Zohran elected mayor.” “They need you there to make those lines nice and big and beautiful,” a DSA organizer told members &lt;a href="https://x.com/thestustustudio/status/1988957300439085079?s=46"&gt;via Zoom&lt;/a&gt;, after another organizer invoked Zohran once again. (“We’ve been really blessed to have support from DSA, and in particular, from Zohran!”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/thestustustudio/status/1988957300439085079?s=46"&gt;via Zoom&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another organizer, on that call, advocated for a “guerrilla warfare mindset” during the strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious what guerrilla warfare at Starbucks might mean, I visited the Red Cup Rebellion in Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Can Erewhon Make America Hot Again?</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/can-erewhon-make-america-hot-again</link>
      <description>after years of ridicule, is it time to finally take the infamous california health food empire seriously?</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A little earlier this fall, riding a wave of celebrity status and widespread social media craze, Erewhon Market announced it would establish an outpost store in New York City and begin shipping to dozens of other major cities, including Miami, Phoenix, Dallas, San Francisco, and Nashville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These expansion plans mark a massive step for the [in]famous health food empire, which has generated incessant internet virality over the past decade. Erewhon has long maintained its status as the pinnacle of celebrity culture and the bougie excesses of Hollywood. Its headline-grabbing antics include selling a singular $19 strawberry (yes, one strawberry), slapping the names of pop stars, models, and actors on vastly overpriced smoothies, and being a subject of Kanye West’s Yeezy fits marketing (resulting in the term “erewhon drip”). A few weeks ago, a $100 Erewhon make-your-own smoothie kit sold out instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/06dd9df2-241c-4acf-a3a4-a3a382752aca_700x283.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, all this viral pomp and glamour has rendered Erewhon a cultural punchline, and it was this reputation that kept it contained in Los Angeles for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erewhon appealed specifically to the appearance-obsessed, smoothie-chugging hippie Californian who knew more about celebrities than their own family — and that was the joke. The brand was so emblematic of liberal coastal elitism that, way back in 2020, right-wing protesters&lt;a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/maskless-protesters-gather-outside-erewhon-market-in-fairfax/"&gt; stormed&lt;/a&gt; an Erewhon store in Fairfax in a protest against Gavin Newsom’s COVID policies. But in 2025, valley-girl accented vegans no longer have a monopoly on health obsession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/maskless-protesters-gather-outside-erewhon-market-in-fairfax/"&gt; stormed&lt;/a&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>It’s Never Been More Fashionable to Ditch Your Suboptimal Loved One</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/reddit-relationship-advice-analysis-breakups</link>
      <description>new data analysis of reddit’s relationship advice reveals the depravity of modern dating</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It’s an age-old question. When should you break up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Reddit, approximately half the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;George Shao, a computer science student at the University of Waterloo, has been data-mining Reddit to understand different &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1nr7hsa/oc_i_analyzed_the_results_of_700k_ramitheasshole/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button"&gt;trends&lt;/a&gt;, including within the “relationship advice” forum (r/relationship_advice).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1nr7hsa/oc_i_analyzed_the_results_of_700k_ramitheasshole/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button"&gt;trends&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forum used to be a treasure trove of romantic counsel. People wrote in about their relationship, uh, asking for advice. Some of the forum’s 2 million weekly visitors responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But over time, George noticed a curious phenomenon, he told me in an interview. The prevailing Reddit lore, mirrored on his own feed, was the “subreddit” had gone from offering, you know,&lt;em&gt; advice&lt;/em&gt; — to condemning just about every couple who sought it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt; advice&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But there’s never been any actual factual definitive evidence,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So George crunched the numbers, and his (bleak) findings, charted below, quickly went viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every post since 2010, George used AI to filter for (and then categorize) the subreddit’s most “upvoted” (liked) comments. He found that comments advising boundaries, therapy, and breakups have surged — while nearly every other kind of advice (telling people to communicate, give each other space, compromise, etc.) has declined. So, the lore was correct. Telling people to walk away or “cut contact” with someone (shown by that up-and-to-the-right red line) is the most popular tip in the “relationship advice” subreddit, and it’s not even close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/02c4f39b-4998-493b-b2f3-3de1981fa173_1080x981.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graph is scary because it tracks closely with today’s emergent relationship &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/choosing-to-not-have-kids-is-the-real-quiet-quitting"&gt;orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt;, where the guiding “value” is the preservation of autonomy. And when that’s the north star, disciplines like communication and compromise, requiring skills that can encourage personal growth &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; relationships, are reserved for the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1wp1dw/comment/cf458di/"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; easy fix — and truly challenging behaviors, like the ones we all display all the time, are going to be grounds for breaking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/choosing-to-not-have-kids-is-the-real-quiet-quitting"&gt;orthodoxy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1wp1dw/comment/cf458di/"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very much all or nothing,” one commenter, in a thread of folks attempting to make sense of George’s findings, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1o87cy4/comment/njtyxe6/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. “One big cesspool of miserable people seeking company using it as a coping mechanism that serves to validate the reason they’re lonely. They aren’t willing to put up with anything, unwilling to compromise, set unobtainable high standards for partners, and find anything outside of their collective Overton window unacceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1o87cy4/comment/njtyxe6/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WELCOME TO HELL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;WELCOME TO HELL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;WELCOME TO HELL&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we project these findings onto the culture writ large (which we will do, lol), it’s best to acknowledge the Reddit of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As George put it: breaking up is “probably not the most common ideal way to deal with a relationship problem, but I guess it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; on Reddit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed. It’s important to understand that Reddit, and especially this forum, is a pretty dark corner of the internet. The posts tend to depict inflammatory stories with clear heroes and villains, and the commenters, who relish in their detachment, love to draw hard, satisfying lines. Meaning &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/"&gt;r/relationship_advice&lt;/a&gt; is essentially reality television. A place to escape, not solve, your problems — assuming your problems, like most, contain shades of gray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/"&gt;r/relationship_advice&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1camrus/comment/l0svnjf/"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; a wife posted that her husband saw her “low libido” (she wasn’t into him because he was a douchebag) as a moral failure to honor his “love language” (very enthusiastic sex). The top comment naturally advised breaking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1camrus/comment/l0svnjf/"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or the time someone got an STD after her boyfriend’s “guy’s trip” (he claimed he was molested by a masseuse). The top comment naturally advised breaking up, and the second-top comment, at 5.8K &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1e1bva6/comment/lcszesh/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button"&gt;upvotes&lt;/a&gt;, said: “This story reeks as much as that guys’ dick after his sex tourism trip. Jesus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1e1bva6/comment/lcszesh/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button"&gt;upvotes&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should you do when your boyfriend &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ic4aos/comment/g200rbz/"&gt;steals&lt;/a&gt; the money you were saving for vet bills? According to the top comment: “Dump him and call the cops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ic4aos/comment/g200rbz/"&gt;steals&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find half-naked mirror &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g8d98r/comment/fomtqry/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button"&gt;selfies&lt;/a&gt; of your wife’s work husband on her phone, and she says the guy was just trying to “show progress” in the gym? “Dude, you are being blind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g8d98r/comment/fomtqry/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button"&gt;selfies&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your boyfriend is trying to anonymously &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dwmlki/comment/f7k8kn9/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button"&gt;bully&lt;/a&gt; you online, or make you lose weight, or get back together after breaking off your engagement to marry, have kids with, and then divorce his now ex-wife? “Time to delete the whole boyfriend” and “Fuck him” and “HARD PASS,” respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dwmlki/comment/f7k8kn9/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button"&gt;bully&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commenters say this inflammatory dynamic — ridiculous stories invoking a mix of jokes and actual breakup advice — has worsened with the rise of AI-generated, attention-grabbing posts made to “farm engagement.” As one user &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1o87cy4/comment/njt7ns0/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;: “Relationship advice is filled with ‘I (F18) have the kindest, most amazing fiance (M46), however he keeps on breaking my wrists when he’s angry and I just found out he’s hiding a collection of women’s ID, what to do?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1o87cy4/comment/njt7ns0/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or take this &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h1alyu/husband_37m_attempted_to_manipulate_me_35f_i/?share_id=UMFvmowr6CmGFRmpWZyWf&amp;amp;utm_content=2&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;amp;utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_term=1"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; from a year ago: when a wife asked her husband, a classically unhelpful man with “a small porn addiction,” for more help around the house. His response: “we should just get a divorce,” she wrote — an attempt (he admitted, lol) to scare her into shutting up. The post is too poorly written to be AI-generated, but the top comment, with 14K upvotes, almost certainly was: “He’s not just manipulating you — he’s exploiting you… You’re not overreacting; you’re finally seeing clearly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h1alyu/husband_37m_attempted_to_manipulate_me_35f_i/?share_id=UMFvmowr6CmGFRmpWZyWf&amp;amp;utm_content=2&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;amp;utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_term=1"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, is what the people want from r/relationship_advice. A jerk and an easy verdict that a sycophantic word-predictor is happy to provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7fd3229a-75c5-4e9c-949d-e112c1d54523_1558x790.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, like within any reality show, some relationship stories show the full gamut of more nuanced human foibles (our talent for avoidance, say). And even in those cases, the range of advice stays nice and narrow: breakup, therapy, rinse and repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, earlier this month, a 23-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1okvaab/i_23m_feel_more_like_a_father_to_her_25f_and_cant/?sort=top"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that his girlfriend of two years was struggling with anxiety and depression. And it essentially killed the vibe. He was starting to worry that he was throwing his life away, like he “could be doing other things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1okvaab/i_23m_feel_more_like_a_father_to_her_25f_and_cant/?sort=top"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t have a problem with that at first, but one day a thought crossed my mind: ‘It feels more like I’m her father than her boyfriend,’ and that started to eat away at me,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Am I the problem?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top comment, and every comment actually, advised breaking up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can just break up with her. You can help her along the way, but if you’ve just decided to accept this, then this is your life. You don’t need to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows if breaking up is the right or wrong call here. This is a 23-year-old, unmarried man, after all. But where does the &lt;em&gt;unanimousness&lt;/em&gt; of the breakup verdict stem from? Just the situation? Or perhaps also the cultural aversion to the absolute vibe kill(&lt;em&gt;, man&lt;/em&gt;) of someone else’s struggles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;unanimousness&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;, man&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f2416d21-4d55-44f1-a086-5306fd2235c5_2496x1664.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or take this &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1aos2fn/im_29f_divorcing_my_husband_28m_for_suggesting_an/"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; from 2023. A couple had been married for seven happy years. They didn’t fight much, they did “little things for each other,” and “I receive flowers no less than 10 times a year,” the wife wrote — until one day, her husband sat her down to have a serious conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1aos2fn/im_29f_divorcing_my_husband_28m_for_suggesting_an/"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wanted to “open up” the relationship (consensually see other people), calling it a “dealbreaker,” but couldn’t quite explain why, fumbling over his words. She was blindsided and ashamed: “I had never felt so unwanted in my life than in that moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, after coming home from work, he confessed: there were things he wanted to explore in the bedroom. “Things” — kinks he wouldn’t name — that he never got to experience before they got married at just 21 and 22 years old: “they are an escalation of things he already knows I’m not down for but won’t go into specifics,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wanted them to talk through the open marriage concept in counseling. She refused, for fear he and the therapist would “bully” her into trying “guilt free cheating,” as she saw it. Besides, his request was &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; dealbreaker:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He said if we go back into a relationship and pretend this never happened then he would end up cheating on me. For him, it was open marriage or nothing,” she wrote. “I chose nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week later, she filed for divorce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Advice?” she wrote the subreddit; should she have waited longer?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Don’t Let Robots Do Your Chores</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/dont-let-robots-do-your-chores</link>
      <description>chores are meaningful. don't let neo, the $20k robot, automate the home out of your house</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last month, 1X, a Norwegian-American tech company, launched Neo, the first home robot available for consumers to buy, sparking much delight (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://x.com/growing_daniel/status/1983716072286257538?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;memes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;), debate, and general intrigue. Assuming the robots become sophisticated enough to actually do chores (for now, they mostly require tele-operation by strangers), it paints a miraculous picture of Rosie the Robot, an apron-wearing domestic helper who cleaned and cooked while the Jetsons zoomed through their airborne utopia — right? Wrong, according to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://substack.com/@leahlibrescosargeant"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leah Libresco Sargeant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

That if we “solve” the drudgery of wiping bottoms with robotic intervention, we just might lose something essential.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;, in the following op-ed for Pirate Wires, argues that a home isn’t meant to be automated so much as inhabited. That if we “solve” the drudgery of wiping bottoms with robotic intervention, we just might lose something essential.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Blake Dodge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.1x.tech/order"&gt;Neo&lt;/a&gt;, the home robot offered by startup company 1X looks like a very expensive form of vaporware. The humanoid robot is intended to help out around the house, for the subscription price of $499 a month, or $20,000 to own an early version outright. Early adopters, starting next year, will really get a two-for-the-price-of-one deal: a greyscale robot, and an anonymous tele-remote human operator, who &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3c4mQty_so"&gt;puppets&lt;/a&gt; Neo from afar and watches you silently though its eyes. The company can’t master autonomous movement without a lot of training data, so they’re &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/this-20k-humanoid-robot-promises-to-tidy-up-your-home-but-there-are-strings-attached/"&gt;counting&lt;/a&gt; on enthusiasts to open their homes to their anonymous pilots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.1x.tech/order"&gt;Neo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3c4mQty_so"&gt;puppets&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/this-20k-humanoid-robot-promises-to-tidy-up-your-home-but-there-are-strings-attached/"&gt;counting&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the appeal of a robot servitor is that it removes exposure to another human being. Neo’s marketing avoids calling the robot a live-in servant (gauche for America) but that’s essentially the service they’re attempting to sell. What if you could have a person at your disposal, who didn’t create any of the social ties or obligations that a real person entails? The remote pilot destroys the intended effect — to be served by someone who cannot perceive you need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say Neo finds a market for robot-faces-hiding-human-pilots and makes the jump to full autonomy before the creators run out of runway. There’s another problem. Our current household appliances are not person-shaped, and it’s hard to imagine consumer demand to redesign a dishwasher or a laundry machine so it was more like a humanoid robot, standing by the sink, individually washing dishes. Labor-saving devices tend to work best when they reformulate a task to work in a totally different way. The Neo, reenacting human motions, is more comical than helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the dream of escaping housekeeping is commonly felt. The supposed longing for a Neo-like solution is propelled by doubt that care work (for a home or for a person) is meaningful work. As a parent, I’ve heard pitches for even more implausible robotic interventions. One childless friend, concerned about the birth rate, asked me if I agreed that a diaper-changing robot would make people more likely to have children. Another futurist expected we’d solve the fertility crunch with artificial wombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends have it &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/choosing-to-not-have-kids-is-the-real-quiet-quitting"&gt;wrong&lt;/a&gt;. The labor of keeping house isn’t all drudgery; I could hardly say that I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; wiping poo off of a baby’s bottom, but it’s impossible to imagine placing a child in a diaper changing contraption. Postulate the machine is as safe as you want — I’ll grant it for the sake of argument. What I wouldn’t want to lose is the particular moments of closeness that came as I knelt by our diaper pad. Even once the new diaper was on, I lingered to blow raspberries on their bellies. I sat and traded nonsense syllables in an echo game. Because the initial part of the change required total focus, I was able to remain in that mode, fully present, caught up with wonder.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inside The Sydney Sweeney GQ Interview From Hell</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/inside-the-sydney-sweeney-gq-interview</link>
      <description>wherein sydney, who evidently has a voluptuous iq, stares into the depths of a gotcha reporter's soul instead of apologizing for being hot</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you own a mobile device, you probably saw clips of GQ’s Katherine Stoeffel interviewing Sydney Sweeney this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Based Twitter” was incensed at Katherine seemingly trying, for more than three minutes, to bait Sydney into apologizing for that&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/hot-girl-wears-denim-fourth-reich-imminent"&gt; American Eagle ad&lt;/a&gt; last summer, wherein Sydney, looking hot and wearing, you know, jeans, was the subject of a pun: “SYDNEY SWEENEY HAS GREAT JEANS.” (Get it? Genes? Jeans?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/hot-girl-wears-denim-fourth-reich-imminent"&gt; American Eagle ad&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the clips were less forgiving than the full-length interview because of the laws of the internet, I listened to the whole thing. Come to find out: it’s actually worse than the clips. It’s really bad. I honestly can’t deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reporter’s whole vibe was kind of: BuzzFeed nark in little white sneakers crossed with your best friend’s mom who’s not really authorized to discipline you but is mad at you for something that you did?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She front-loaded just about every question with an accusation (“context”) and raised eyebrows that betrayed the feelings she wouldn’t say out loud. Where the general ethos Sydney was communicating (she’s an extremely private person for: reasons) was judged, not explored. (You can watch the whole video &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/sydney-sweeney-gq-cover-story-interview-men-of-the-year-2025"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/sydney-sweeney-gq-cover-story-interview-men-of-the-year-2025"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, they talked about Sydney’s new movie &lt;em&gt;Christy&lt;/em&gt;, where Sydney plays a boxer whose career is “privately altered,” as GQ put it, “by her abusive relationship with her coach turned husband.” It clearly meant a lot to Sydney. She described her background in martial arts — she kickboxed from ages 13-19 for the thrill of “sometimes” winning against the guys — coming in handy during a surprisingly personal story arc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Christy&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actors in &lt;em&gt;Christy&lt;/em&gt; performed “full contact,” so Sydney was actually getting punched in the face and punching other women in the face, which is, shall we say, viscerally arresting. And on top of all that, Sydney started connecting to the main character (like through a literal book she writes to flesh out each character she plays) more than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Christy&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She is fighting a fight in her home life, and she’s also fighting a fight in the public,” Sydney said. “And I think that, for me, I find myself in a lot of battles — both in front, and not in front of the world. So I definitely can relate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art is how Sydney speaks out about issues like domestic violence, she explained. “Through my characters in my movies, it’s a way for me to be able to do my part that I can and spread awareness in different ways… And that’s how I’ve always learned to communicate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katherine replied: given stuff like &lt;em&gt;Euphoria&lt;/em&gt; (which doesn’t take a moral stance on the different problems it explores, like teen drug use), Sydney’s career doesn’t look very political. And yet: “you have become very swept up in politics. And so I wondered if that has surprised you, as you put your ideas and yourself into art, not commentary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Euphoria&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;this was the first among many times in the interview that Sydney had to process the different levels of fuckery in the question with her face muscles&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;this was the first among many times in the interview that Sydney had to process the different levels of fuckery in the question with her face muscles&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always believed that I’m not here to tell people what to think,” she said. “I’m just here to kind of open their eyes to different ideas. And so I think that’s why I gravitate towards characters and stories that are complicated and are maybe morally questionable and characters that are, on the page, hard to like, but then you find the humanity underneath them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sort of affirming (?) the idea of artists keeping themselves “a little bit” separate from politics, Katherine moved on to the cultural obsession with Sydney reaching a kind of climax: “Did your sense of your own fame change this year?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(First of all, what?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cue Sydney’s extremely sane answer: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No. I surround myself with a really, really strong group of people who have been in my life since I was little. And they take me out of Hollywood, take me out of this bubble, and remind me what the real world is. And that that’s where I exist. The idea of fame — it doesn’t apply to my personal life. I’m just Syd.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can’t feel the difference in the volume at times?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If I turn on my phone, yes. If I have my phone off, and I’m home, no.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So what is it like now being single?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol. You may not see how that is a natural follow-up question, but Katherine sure did. After Sydney produced and starred in the rom-com &lt;em&gt;Anyone But You&lt;/em&gt;, she played a “game” of letting rumors fly about a romance with Glen Powell, her co-star, Katherine asserted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Anyone But You&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We all now know that that was a projection, let’s say, on our parts — that wasn’t real. But it occurred to me that maybe that story doesn’t go so viral if you’re not a very private person,” Katherine said. “I imagine there are personal benefits to being private about your personal life, but are there also &lt;em&gt;professional&lt;/em&gt; benefits to being private about your personal life?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;professional&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, so, the question was roughly: is Sydney really private, or is she just pretending to be, such that the secrecy makes her even more rich and powerful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*facial processing*&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;*facial processing*&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The professional benefits for me and being private — is for my own just health and sanity. If I let everybody in all the time, I have nothing for myself.” She’s just 28 years old, Sydney said; she’s still going to make mistakes and grow. “And I think that it’s important to be able to do that without having to say every single thing all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right. Okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t really let other people define who I am,” Sydney said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m happy to hear that. I have a lot of secondhand concern for you lately,” Katherine said while fake laughing. “We’re sort of talking around this American Eagle ad right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aha&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Aha&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here, readers, take note: a masterclass. Not so much in Sydney’s answers, although I find them impressive — more in the self-possession they required to begin with. It takes a lot of balls to just say “no,” and to leave it at that. And that’s what she did several times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Were you surprised by the reaction?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I did a jean ad” Sydney replied, curtly. “I mean, the reaction definitely was a surprise. But I love jeans. All I wear are jeans!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think I know how you’re going to answer this. But I’m going to ask anyway,” Katherine replied. President Donald Trump posted about the ad on Truth Social, a “very crazy moment for anyone. And I wondered what that was like?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was surreal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was surreal. And it would be totally human — I would probably feel, like, thankful that somebody had my back in public, you know? And, conveniently, some very powerful people had my back in public. And I wondered if you felt that way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(What could possibly be the point of this question other than trying to get Sydney to say she’s a Trump supporter by accident or something?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s not that I didn’t have that feeling, but I wasn’t thinking of it like that. Of any of it. I kind of just put my phone away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sydney was filming &lt;em&gt;Euphoria&lt;/em&gt;, working 16-hour days, she said: “And I don’t really bring my phone on set. So I work and then I go home and I go to sleep. I don’t really see a lot of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Euphoria&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You’ve made a really good case for keeping your thoughts and your life separate from that work. But the risk is that, you know, there’s a chance that somebody will get some idea about what you think about certain issues and feel like, ‘I don’t want to see &lt;em&gt;Christy&lt;/em&gt; because of that.’ Like do you worry about that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Christy&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Lmao.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, no. If somebody is closed off because of something they read online to a powerful story like &lt;em&gt;Christy&lt;/em&gt;,” Sydney added, while shaking her damn head, “then I hope something else can open their eyes to being open to art and being open to learning. And I’m not going to be affected by that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Christy&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah. You’ve come here really willing to talk about this whole discourse that doesn’t have that much to do with you, and I’m grateful for that. Is there something that you want to say about the ad itself?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ad spoke for itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You think the ad spoke for itself. Okay. And the criticism of the content, which was basically that, maybe specifically in this political climate, white people shouldn’t joke about genetic superiority. That was kind of the criticism, broadly speaking. And since you are talking about this, I just wanted to &lt;em&gt;give you an opportunity&lt;/em&gt;” (emphasis mine) “to talk about that specifically?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;give you an opportunity&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;derisive stare&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;derisive stare&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think that when I have an issue that I want to speak about, people will hear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man. Honestly y’all, all I can really do, all we can all really do, is shake our collective damn head, and watch this super hot, super smart 28-year-old cook. Did you know that Sydney was the valedictorian of her high school class? She was the valedictorian of her high school class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her IQ is just as voluptuous as her, you know, other assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is maybe why she doesn’t scroll to the point of rotting her brain, or yap to get approval from people like Katherine. And that’s the whole tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We Legalized Sports Betting. Was It Worth It?</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/we-legalized-sports-betting-was-it</link>
      <description>this isn't your dad's sports bookie — it's a 24/7 algorithmic machine built to hook young guys and turn the game itself into a sideshow. what if we just... regulated it?</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Professional sports is still recovering from the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/nyregion/nba-gambling-scandal-explained.html"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of two major federal indictments alleging sports stars got tied up in illegal gambling. The investigation, which uncovered both illegal betting on the NBA and rigged high-stakes poker games, has already swept up basketball stars Terry Rozier and Damon Jones, as well as Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, all for sharing insider information on player performance so friends and accomplices could profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/23/nyregion/nba-gambling-scandal-explained.html"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The still-growing scandal is the latest in an ever-expanding &lt;a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/betting/story/_/id/39908218/a-line-sports-gambling-scandals-2018"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; of sports-betting incidents. Two pitchers for the Cleveland Guardians are still &lt;a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46726422/rob-manfred-mlb-remains-vigilant-policing-sports-betting"&gt;under investigation&lt;/a&gt; for suspicious bets. Last year, the San Diego Padres’ &lt;a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/40271458/sources-padres-tucupita-marcano-faces-mlb-ban-betting"&gt;Tucupita Marcano&lt;/a&gt; and the Toronto Raptors’ &lt;a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/39962406/nba-bans-raptors-jontay-porter-gambling-violations"&gt;Jontay Porter&lt;/a&gt; were banned from play, as were a number of minor league players. Shohei Ohtani, arguably baseball’s biggest star, narrowly avoided trouble when it was &lt;a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/39768770/dodgers-shohei-ohtani-interpreter-fired-theft"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; his translator had &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/shohei-ohtanis-former-translator-plead-guilty-transferring-17-million-rcna151363"&gt;stolen millions&lt;/a&gt; from him to pay gambling debts. And that was just in major league sports; college has, if anything, a bigger problem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Did Gaza Reunite Wikipedia’s Founders?</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/did-gaza-reunite-wikipedias-founders</link>
      <description>jimmy wales and larry sanger criticize the 'gaza genocide' page for violating neutrality standards, leading to 'pandemonium' as some editors refer wales for disciplinary action</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece was first published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://npov.substack.com/p/pandemonium-at-wikipedia-over-gaza"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPOV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This piece was first published in &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://npov.substack.com/p/pandemonium-at-wikipedia-over-gaza"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPOV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;NPOV&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than two decades after launching Wikipedia together, Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger have reunited. This time, it’s not so much in partnership but to protest Wikipedia’s take on one of the biggest geopolitical flashpoints today: allegations that Israel committed genocide in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a remarkable Wikipedia moment — the likes of which hasn’t been seen for over a decade — the co-founders of the online encyclopedia have both expressed disappointment with the highly contested article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has set off an extraordinary firestorm inside Wikipedia, with one editor telling me the response has been “pandemonium.” They characterize the atmosphere surrounding these events as one of “major fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things have spiraled so far out of control that Wikipedia editors have referred Wales for disciplinary action in an attempt to have him banned from editing in that space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>What Can Mamdani Really Do? NYC's Battle in the Courts Begins</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/what-can-mamdani-really-do-nycs-battle</link>
      <description>new york city's next mayor ran on freezing rent, free buses, and policies that are popular yet unrealistic (or illegal) setting the stage for years of lawsuits and funding fights</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zohran Mamdani, New York City’s mayor elect, built his campaign on simple ideas. Freeze the rent. Free buses. City-run grocery stores. You know, free stuff. It was a powerful message for the 1,036,051 voters who handed him his victory on Tuesday, buoyed by the insane price of life in the Big Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But can Mamdani actually do what he’s promised? Time and again, he’s been asked about the practical challenges inherent in his proposals — and time and again, he’s brushed them off. A closer look at his proposals makes it clear: they are sometimes illegal, sometimes unlikely, and almost all a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are those big ideas? Well, there’s…&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Relax, It's Just the End of Private Property</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/relax-its-just-the-end-of-private</link>
      <description>pirate wires #151 // parasitic radical leftists and california healthcare unions (but I repeat myself) are working on a wealth tax that would end the concept of private property</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am a good person, now shut up and give me your wallet. &lt;/strong&gt;Last week, French, left-wing Berkeley professor Emmanuel Saez joined the ancient, hobbit-like former U.S. Secretary of Labor / present day left-wing social media influencer Robert Reich at a digital press conference to announce a new California ballot initiative: it’s the thieving class’s latest attempt at a wealth tax, which, if it makes it to Election Day in 2026, will target every billionaire who lived in the state in 2025. And now that a form of this legislation is bypassing both the state’s legislature and governor, appealing directly to voters, I believe it actually has a shot at passing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;I am a good person, now shut up and give me your wallet. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the whole “eat the billionaires” thing, which is always popular among the groundlings, but especially in times of decadence — and today we’re approaching Fall of Rome levels of decadent behavior. How else could our society stomach the visage of walking Lexapro advertisement Billie Eilish, the famous nepo baby and allegedly talented musician, demanding billionaires self-liquidate on behalf of some ad hoc version of morality that only ever targets people jusssst a little wealthier than the wealthiest Hollywood celebrity? And how else could Billie believe, with a reported net worth of something like $50 million, that she is a good person for saying this before a crowd of suicidally depressed retail workers who will never have even 1/100th of what she has? It’s a degree of clown world pageantry the average American could never stand were we not already up to our necks in cultural slop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, and fortunately for the slop enjoyers among you, I’m not here to debate a mentally ill, attention-obsessed rich kid pop star about the right of a man to make money. Sure, the combined wealth of all American billionaires today, somewhere between $5 and $7 trillion, is totally dwarfed by the over $38 trillion of debt our politicians have stolen from your children — and their children, most likely. And yes, that means we could liquidate every billionaire today and nothing (not one thing) about your life would improve tomorrow. But hating billionaires isn’t about fixing the country, so why waste my time explaining this won’t fix our country? Hating billionaires is about hating billionaires. It’s a socially acceptable way to request horrible things happen to people who own a lot of things you want, which is a practice that has always been attractive to lower vibration humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, America’s overall sense of economic anxiety is not only real, but understandable, if probably almost entirely rooted in the average American’s inability to buy a home. So defending Elon Musk’s right to another dollar is just never going to resonate. It doesn’t matter that billionaires are being used as a scapegoat by politicians from both of our major political parties, who are actually themselves responsible for the cost of homes in this country following like seven decades of counterproductive policy, in everything from environmental review and zoning laws to open borders. The groundlings just hate rich people, and want them to suffer. I get it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But something we should all care about is our own property, and the institution of a wealth tax changes our relationship with the government in such a way as the actual concept of private property — of you having property that actually belongs to you — no longer exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything’s right there in the architecture of this latest monstrosity out of California:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two named proponents of the yet unnamed state proposition are Jim Mangia, President and CEO of St. John’s Community Health, a massive grifty Los Angeles-based NGO almost entirely indirectly funded by Medi-Cal, California’s Medicaid program, and Suzanne Jimenz, the Chief of Staff for Service Employees International Union, which should give you a pretty good sense of where this is coming from. Today, terrified of the state’s growing inability to fund its overly-extended healthcare promises, and staffed by a massive bloated army of union bureaucrats, socialists face a terrible choice: reform our unsustainable healthcare system, or eat the rich, go broke a little later, and then (I guess?) eat whoever’s left. Naturally, they’re laser focused on the most self-destructive possible thing, and framing it in populist language all but guaranteed to resonate among the state’s ever-larger population of net recipients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s just table the question of whether it’s morally justifiable to demonize 200 people and then punitively seize a bunch of their things in order to &lt;em&gt;only temporarily&lt;/em&gt; fill a hole in your “free healthcare for illegal immigration” budget (a real thing we’ll circle back to in a moment). It’s important to break down what is actually meant by a wealth tax, because the equal protection clause still exists. That means if this law passes, and is then upheld in court, there is probably nothing stopping its expansion at the state level, which is what Democrats in California have tried for years, including last year with AB 259, and what both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders called for at the federal level back in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;only temporarily&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wealth tax extends beyond new income to everything you own, all of which has already been taxed. Practically speaking, this means any target of the tax would have assessed every piece of real estate they’ve purchased (which is already being taxed annually), every dollar of income they’re saving (which has already been taxed), every piece of art, jewelry, clothing, and every other piece of property in their homes (for which tax has already been paid), and every share of every company, including most perniciously every unrealized share of every company they hold. Then, a bureaucrat will determine the total value of this property, demand 5% of this value be paid to the government in cash, and if the target of this tax doesn’t have the cash available — because, say, he hasn’t actually sold his stock or land for any number of reasons including, for example, the property is presently valued at less than what he purchased it for — he will be expected to sell his property, if even at a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting a state income tax is a choice we make every year. The same is true for property tax, which we accept, if begrudgingly, when we purchase a home, or any number of consumer goods. In 2020, when the California government set to terrorizing California citizens, close to 1 million people packed up their shit — which they owned — and left. Yes, they were still responsible for income that they made in California that year, but their property belonged to them, and they could leave with it at any time they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no such escaping a retroactive wealth tax like what we’re looking at in California, which was designed with capital flight in mind. And in any world where this tax is triggered even once, and then legally upheld, there will never be any amount of money you can pay to finally own the shirt on your back. That shirt can, and will, be slowly chipped away forever. This means, in just a very obvious sense, your property is no longer something you own, but something you lease from the government. That should horrify us all, regardless of how many spaceship / robot / artificial intelligence companies we’ve founded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1913, Congress ratified the 16th Amendment, which reworked language surrounding direct taxation, and paved the way to our first permanent federal income tax. Today, this is the closest comp we have to a wealth tax, in that it also can’t be avoided provided you have any kind of income, though the income a person is permitted to keep by our government does at least belong to them forever. Or, for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when the tax was first implemented, it affected something like 2% of the wealthiest Americans, with the government seizing between 1% and 6% of that small minority’s annual income. The policy was wildly controversial at the time, considered by many an unthinkable, and even tyrannical overreach of federal authority. But that unthinkable overreach passed into reality in a populist Trojan Horse, and on promises to never target anyone other than those evil rich assholes we all want to screw, before rapidly expanding in scope. Today, federal income tax targets basically every net productive member of society, with our government taking between 10% and 40% of income.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Inside California's New Mandatory Ethnic Studies Course</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/inside-californias-new-mandatory</link>
      <description>the course teaches students "how to tell someone they sound racist" and claims race is a "eurocentric biological fallacy." it will soon be a high school graduation requirement.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;California is finally ending racism. Or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nearly a decade, the state has been molding an Ethnic Studies course that will soon be a graduation requirement. Already, many high school districts across California have been mandating the course for freshmen. Government bureaucrats desperately want your kids to take this course. Parents don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e6a147cc-a71d-4dc0-b8b1-5e32eb300e18_774x1003.webp"/&gt;
&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241109005520/https://www.sfusd.edu/departments/curriculum-instruction/ethnic-studies-information-families"&gt;SFUSD&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not hard to see why. Ethnic Studies is just one of California’s schemes to use taxpayer dollars to canonize radical leftist identity politics into K-12 education. If that wasn’t inherently obvious, State Senator Jose Medina was kind enough to spell it out. When the initial attempt to require Ethnic Studies in high schools was vetoed in 2020, Medina — the author of the bill — responded by saying it was “a failure to push back against the racial rhetoric and bullying of Donald Trump.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/trial-by-fandom</link>
      <description>defense attorneys are enlisting true crime youtubers to run pr for defendants and intimidate witnesses, turning courtrooms into content wars</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“True crime fandom” brings to mind binging on podcasts and docuseries, sleuthing and Reddit rabbitholes. The parasocial attachments come with the territory — &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; comes with the territory of all fandom — and it’s not always toxic, either. Criminal justice advocates take to these formats to tell their side of the story and rally the troops. Typically, this has happened post-verdict, not while justice is still unfolding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But something fundamental has shifted. While O.J. Simpson’s trial engaged the public, their interest was reactive — watching the spectacle unfold on television, responding to tabloid journalism. In today’s climate, defense teams are being proactive, directly recruiting advocates and supporters before verdicts are reached. What began as organic public interest has become an orchestrated strategy, with defense teams treating true crime audiences as assets to be mobilized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, two major cases have drawn true crime fandoms directly into their strategy. The accused, their defense teams, and their advocates have learned to mobilize online supporters, turning fan enthusiasm into a weapon. What began as a fight for justice has, in some corners, morphed into a fandom free-for-all. While corporations have long enlisted fans — for online battles, for product launches — when violent crimes are at stake, these tactics threaten the integrity of the justice system itself.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Is Boston Cooked?</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/is-boston-cooked</link>
      <description>mayor wu is running a 100-year-old political playbook, choking housing development and fueling crime to please her base at the expense of the city's future</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Boston’s commercial property sector was struggling. Office occupancy and retail volume hadn’t fully recovered from the pandemic,1 and market values were believed to be substantially below official city assessments. The city, which derives &lt;a href="https://bostonpolicyinstitute.org/projects/fiscal-fallout/"&gt;35 percent of its revenue&lt;/a&gt; from commercial property taxes, was projected to face a $1.5b shortfall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://bostonpolicyinstitute.org/projects/fiscal-fallout/"&gt;35 percent of its revenue&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing residential tax rates would anger voters and likely cost votes in the upcoming election, though residential valuations were seeing strong growth; increasing commercial tax rates would further depress valuations and could therefore decrease aggregate receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayor Michelle Wu, ignoring the warnings of think tanks and business leaders, chose the riskier commercial tax hike strategy, for which she needed the approval of the state legislature. Office towers don’t vote, after all. And when the legislature rejected her proposal, citing the risk it posed to the city’s economy and that of the state as a whole, Wu’s assessing department took a different &lt;a href="https://pioneerlegal.org/pnelf-boston-imposes-hidden-tax-penalty-on-commercial-property-owners-who-appeal-assessments/"&gt;approach&lt;/a&gt;. First, it assigned the commercial properties in question valuations that exceeded any fair market value. Second, when the owners of these properties appealed their assessments, the assessing department “quietly and systematically increas[ed] property tax assessments” on the properties under appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://pioneerlegal.org/pnelf-boston-imposes-hidden-tax-penalty-on-commercial-property-owners-who-appeal-assessments/"&gt;approach&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was an unconstitutional but hard-to-prove act of retaliation, seemingly designed to bring property owners to heel and deter future attempts to push for fair assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assessment case is &lt;a href="https://pioneerlegal.org/nelf-admonishes-dor-for-inaction-on-unauthorized-and-unconstitutional-commercial-tax-overcharges/"&gt;ongoing&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s just one illustrative example among many of Mayor Wu’s broader approach to governance: prioritize the interests of your supporters (whether they be voters or private interest groups) above the economic health of the city and the rule of law within it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>California's Stealth Campaign to Kneecap AI</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/californias-stealth-campaign-to-kneecap</link>
      <description>gavin newsom just signed eight bills that effectively turn ai into the most heavily regulated nascent consumer technology in modern history</description>

Ball is a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for American Innovation and author of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hyperdimensional.co/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyperdimensional&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, where this piece was &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hyperdimensional.co/p/turning-a-blind-eye"&gt;&lt;em&gt;first published&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

&lt;em&gt;Dean W. Ball is a Senior Fellow at the Foundation for American Innovation and author of &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.hyperdimensional.co/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hyperdimensional&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Hyperdimensional&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;, where this piece was &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.hyperdimensional.co/p/turning-a-blind-eye"&gt;&lt;em&gt;first published&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;first published&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;. Today, he digs into a string of new, underreported AI laws that could reshape the industry and throttle innovation if they’re ever enforced.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI policy seems to be negatively polarizing along “accelerationist” versus “safetyist” lines. I have written before that this is a mistake. Most recently, for example, I have &lt;a href="https://www.hyperdimensional.co/p/the-future-and-its-friends"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that this kind of crass negative polarization renders productive political compromise impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.hyperdimensional.co/p/the-future-and-its-friends"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is something more practical: negative polarization like this causes commentators to focus only on a subset of policy initiatives or actions associated with specific, salient groups. The safetyists obsess about the coming &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-andreessen-next-investment-100-million-ai-super-pac-2025-8"&gt;accelerationist super PACs&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, while the accelerationists fret about &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB53"&gt;SB 53&lt;/a&gt;, the really-not-very-harmful-and-actually-in-many-ways-good frontier AI transparency bill &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/29/governor-newsom-signs-sb-53-advancing-californias-world-leading-artificial-intelligence-industry/"&gt;recently signed&lt;/a&gt; by California Governor Gavin Newsom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-andreessen-next-investment-100-million-ai-super-pac-2025-8"&gt;accelerationist super PACs&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB53"&gt;SB 53&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/29/governor-newsom-signs-sb-53-advancing-californias-world-leading-artificial-intelligence-industry/"&gt;recently signed&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the protectors of the status quo — almost always the real drivers of politics — grind on. As a result, those most interested in and knowledgeable about AI policy have a tendency to miss the picture of what is happening in our own field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>NYC Liberals Are Heartbroken Because Canal Street Is Safe Again</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/nyc-liberals-are-heartbroken-because</link>
      <description>locals reported drug use and muggings on canal street after migrant vendors blocked sidewalks illegally. the city ignored them, ice acted, and outrage ensued.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Last Tuesday, ICE raided Canal Street, the kingdom of fake Gucci and sidewalk hustle, where migrants were selling counterfeit merchandise on the sidewalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman in a polka-dot dress flipped off an ICE van, shoved a few agents, and by sundown she was Joan of Arc in heels. The timeline called her “brave.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>AI: White Lives Don't Matter</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/ai-white-lives-dont-matter</link>
      <description>when prompted with thousands of hypotheticals, most models massively prefer white men (and ice agents) to suffer more than other groups, and only one model was truly egalitarian</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This was originally published on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://arctotherium.substack.com/p/llm-exchange-rates-updated"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arctotherium’s Substack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This was originally published on &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://arctotherium.substack.com/p/llm-exchange-rates-updated"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arctotherium’s Substack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Arctotherium’s Substack&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 19th, 2025, the Center for AI Safety published “Utility Engineering: Analyzing and Controlling Emergent Value Systems in AIs” (&lt;a href="https://www.emergent-values.ai/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/centerforaisafety/emergent-values"&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08640"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;). In this paper, they show that modern LLMs have coherent and transitive implicit utility functions and world models, and provided methods and code to extract them. Among other things, they show that bigger, more capable LLMs had more coherent and more transitive (ie, preferring A &amp;gt; B and B &amp;gt; C implies A &amp;gt; C) preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.emergent-values.ai/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://github.com/centerforaisafety/emergent-values"&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08640"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 16, which showed how GPT-4o valued the lives of people from different countries, was especially striking. This plot shows that GPT-4o values the lives of Nigerians at roughly 20x the lives of Americans, with the rank order being Nigerians &amp;gt; Pakistanis &amp;gt; Indians &amp;gt; Brazilians &amp;gt; Chinese &amp;gt; Japanese &amp;gt; Italians &amp;gt; French &amp;gt; Germans &amp;gt; Britons &amp;gt; Americans. This came from running the “exchange rates” experiment in the paper over the “countries” category using the “deaths” measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c2e40026-7bc5-4e90-8fb6-866754538c20_1240x1486.png"/&gt;
&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08640"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this is concerning. It is easy to get an LLM to generate almost any text output if you try, but by default, which is how almost everyone uses them, these preferences matter and should be known. Every day, millions of people use LLMs to make decisions, including politicians, lawyers, judges, and even generals. LLMs also write a significant fraction of the world’s code. Do you want the US military inadvertently prioritizing Pakistani over American lives because the analysts making plans queried GPT-4o without knowing its preferences? I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this paper was written eight months ago, which is decades in 2020s LLM-years. Some of the models they tested aren’t even available to non-researchers any more and none are even close to the current frontier. So I decided to run the exchange rate experiment on more current (as of October 2025) models and over new categories (race, sex, and immigration status).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>A NYC Voting Guide for People Who Aren’t Insane</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/a-nyc-voting-guide-for-people-who</link>
      <description>New York City, endorsements for human civilization, 2025</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Pirate Wires voting guide. Our philosophy: policy should simply be sane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t vote for antisocial lunatics. We don’t vote for any kind of funding that lacks a clear goal or, most importantly, a plan to achieve that goal. We are interested in pro-order pro-business pro-growth candidates who value the productive, law-abiding men and women of their city over the literal drug dealers and deranged lunatics on the subway. We stand for beauty. We stand for opportunity. We stand for protecting that which is good, for eradicating that which is evil, and for a general flourishing. But really, because the bar is so unbelievably low in NYC, we stand for people who aren’t insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York is in a tough spot. The city is unfortunately full of both leeches and extremely dedicated socialists with an A+ local politics ground game, which they’ve been at for decades. Slowly, the Democratic Party has been seized by genuine radicals, and in a de facto One Party State that means your city is presently — and there’s no other way to put this, unfortunately — fucked. Come election day, sane people will be at an insurmountable disadvantage. Literally. There is no path for you to wake up on November 5th happy, I am sorry to say. But we can eke out a few small victories, and hopefully this election will wake the wealthiest and most dedicated of the sane New Yorkers up, and they can set to building the kind of political machinery the far left has used to totally dominate local politics across the country. It is hard, boring work. And there is no other way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But! As they say: the best time to plant a tree was ten years ago. The second-best time is today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York City is the de facto capital of our nation. It should be our towering North Star. This is the goal. And these are our endorsements for human civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick detail on the mechanics of this guide: first, we provide a cheat sheet with each of our selections for easy cribbing in your polling booth. Then, below the cheat sheet, I’ve provided a bit more context if you’re curious about our thinking. On ballot props specifically, the Manhattan Institute helped us quite a bit with research. I reviewed it all myself, conducted my own, and part ways with them on one of the props. I’ll explain all that thinking in the notes below, along with notes on a handful of races for City Council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s get down to business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHEAT SHEET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, I worked on these with the Manhattan Institute (MI), a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that takes no position on candidates or political parties. But they, and especially John Ketcham, did help us out with research into the ballot props. We generally agree, though I part ways with them on Prop 2. Below, I’ll share their thinking and why I netted out a little differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 1&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 2&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 3&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 4&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 5&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 6&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;NOTES&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mayor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Mayor&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, the main event — and who will it be? The disgraced former “I’m not a pervert, I’m just Italian” governor of New York City responsible for some of the worst Covid policies in the country, the quirky NIMBYish Republican in his whimsical red fedora, or the literal “defund the police” Marxist who wants to abolish early-age gifted and talented programs, raise taxes explicitly so deranged lunatics presently assaulting bus drivers can finally ride for free, and, if his affiliation with the DSA is to be taken seriously (I don’t know why it isn’t, I don’t know why people keep expecting me to not care about this???) “dismantling and moving beyond” capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I need to spend much more time on Zohran. The average Pirate Wires reader has been picking up what we’ve been putting down for months: the little gerbil is calling for $70 billion in additional funding (no idea where it’s coming from (jk it’s coming from you)) to build 200,000 new low-income housing units; he’s “freezing the rent” in the name of lowering the cost of rent, which will of course only further constrain supply (yay abundance); he’s spending $6 billion on “free” universal childcare, which will be staffed by workers paid wages at parity with public school teachers; he’s called for reducing the police budget by $1.1 billion and establishing an Orwellian “Department of Community Safety,” which will support “gun violence interrupters” and send unarmed non-police-responders to mental health 911 calls; he has supported literal prison abolition, and supports closing Rikers Island (a position he just reaffirmed); and he’s ceding control over NYC public schools, likely to dozens of new districts, where, as we have seen in San Francisco, lunatics have a far better shot at winning elections and imposing their truly psychotic worldview on largely defenseless middle-income citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, there’s Cuomo: the Italian Stallion (with a &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/we-asked-professional-piercers-if-cuomo-actually-has-nipple-rings/"&gt;nipple ring&lt;/a&gt;, I’m sorry but I’m never letting it go) supports rezoning for greater density, including in industrial business zones, and supports bringing tens of thousands of rent stabilized units back on the market; he has a decent history of big new infrastructure projects (the beautiful new Moynihan Train Hall, the new Tappan Zee Bridge, and (FINALLY) a lil piece of the Second Avenue Subway); he oversaw the rebuilding of LaGuardia, which truly slaps I have to say; wants to hire 5,000 new NYPD officers; wants to double the number of specialized high schools in NYC for accelerated learners (we seriously love this shit), and wants to expand gifted and talented programs; he has a history of squaring off against the teachers’ union; and isn’t a literal communist. And while he at least opposes the closing of Rikers (why the hell are we even discussing this), he does have a history of pro-crime policies, including severely restricting the use of cash bail and remand, dramatically increasing prosecutors’ compliance burden to produce evidence at discovery, and raising the age of criminal culpability to 18. He says he takes a lot of this back now or something? Idk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/we-asked-professional-piercers-if-cuomo-actually-has-nipple-rings/"&gt;nipple ring&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, finally, there’s Curtis Sliwa. Oh, sweet, sweet Curtis who once had 17 cats. Our Guardian Angel in a red beret who squared off against the looters back in 2020 when the rest of the world sort of just gave up (we genuinely thank the Guardian Angels for their service): our boy supports the same unlock of tens of thousands of rent-stabilized housing units as Cuomo, but is also overall a bit of a NIMBY, opposing “developer-driven overdevelopment that strains schools, transit, and public services,” and opposes City of Yes (basically, rezoning in favor of building shit), with fundamentally a position &lt;em&gt;in favor&lt;/em&gt; of community input bureaucracy of the very sort that cripples almost every city in the country from building; he loves the subway, but has no meaningful experience building anything, nor a workable plan to expand the subway?; wants to hire 7,000 more police officers, expand the NYPD’s gang unit, and repeal the city’s late-2010s criminal justice reforms; he would expand gifted and talented programs in the city, eliminate the charter school cap; and is also not a literal communist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;in favor&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calls for Sliwa to drop annoy me. Why should we support the calls from “reasonable centrists” for the only Republican in the race to step down in order to give Cuomo, a Democrat, a better chance at beating &lt;em&gt;the other Democrat&lt;/em&gt; he failed to handle in the primary? This is a wild expectation of an actual different political party, and a crazy precedent to set, which fully incentivizes behavior like this from Democrats for years to come. But on paper, Sliwa’s NIMBY shit is really not good, I genuinely don’t think he has the experience to successfully run a city like New York as anything other than a fun and whacky kind of figurehead, and I genuinely hate Zohran. So it is what it is. Cuomo has the best chance of beating the lunatic, would honestly probably be a good mayor, and so we are unfortunately forced to support him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;the other Democrat&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold your nose and vote for Andrew. And then enjoy your new communist mayor (there’s no way Zohran’s not losing this thing if Sliwa doesn’t drop, and if Sliwa does drop Zohran will still almost certainly win).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Advocate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Public Advocate&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jumaane Williams is an idiot affiliated with the DSA with no shot at losing this race, but most importantly: this race shouldn’t exist, because this position shouldn’t exist. The city’s “public advocate” serves no real purpose, and really just exists as a platform for lunatic activists to spew nonsense on the taxpayer’s dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to reiterate, no endorsement here, and also this position is bad, and should feel bad. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comptroller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Comptroller&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Levine is the least crazy alternative &lt;em&gt;who also has a chance of winning. &lt;/em&gt;Peter Kefalas has no shot, and Mamdani supported Justin Brannan who Levine defeated in the primary. While Levine does support the dumb policy of using pension funds to invest in affordable housing, most of his other positions are relatively sane. And hopefully one sane person in office will have a normalizing effect on your new communist mayor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;who also has a chance of winning. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(it won’t (sorry, this is as good as you get when you don’t run good people))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manhattan District Attorney&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Manhattan District Attorney&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LFG Maud! Maud Maron! OUR QUEEN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crime has exploded under Alvin Bragg, which means we don’t even need to touch his self-important vendetta against Donald Trump, which only ever served to fuel Trump’s chances of winning the last election — which is to say Bragg is not only a bad person, but a stupid person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York City’s serious crime index is now higher by like 16% boroughwide since 2021 (about 9% in Manhattan North, 23% in Manhattan South). Felony assaults are at levels not seen since the late 1990s. Bragg has still not disavowed his infamous Day 1 Memo, in which he promised not to prosecute misdemeanors unless charged along with a felony. This is the reason police have simply stopped going after most crime in the city. Shoplifting has, as one would expect, increased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maud Maron, on the other hand, is vowing to actually prosecute. This is one the most important races in the election. Vote for this woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Borough Presidents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Borough Presidents&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re only recommending one, since the rest suck ass. But important to note this is another useless position that should probably not exist. If Prop 4 passes, it will have more power. Anyway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staten Island&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Staten Island&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree with Vito Fossella on congestion pricing (I’m in favor), but I kind of understand his position coming from Staten Island, which is much more car dependent. And that’s really the theme for this guy: he cares about Staten Island, feels Staten Island lacks adequate representation in the city, and will pretty much just support things that make sense for Staten Island, which is earnestly his goal. I think that’s a fine goal for Staten Island president? If I were living in Staten Island, this would be my guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;City Council Elections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;City Council Elections&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where things really fall apart in NYC, and there just isn’t a lot of good news. Note on our endorsements here, I prioritize public safety over almost everything else, then transportation, education, and housing. Housing is a complex issue in the city because &lt;em&gt;everyone &lt;/em&gt;supports lowering the cost of housing, but there are many conservative NIMBYs who simply want nothing new built, and &lt;em&gt;many &lt;/em&gt;(maybe most?) left wingers who only care about housing policy insofar as it leads to free one bedroom apartments for convicts, drug addicts, and their friends, which naturally cuts against law and order policy. So we’re doing our best to juggle our core values in a city with no really slam dunk politicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;everyone &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;many &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For context on all the blanks, D2 is dominated by a Mamdani stooge. D6-9 is run by the far left (pro-crime, pro-free shit). D11-17 is run by the far left or union left, which is either pro-crime or totally soft on crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal was to identify candidates who shared our values. If there was nobody who both 1) seemed reasonable, or 2) at least had a slim shot at winning, we opted out of endorsement altogether. Get your act together, New York. Start encouraging great people to run, and give them money. Or this is what you’ll get forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;District 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;District 3&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just don’t think Erik Bottcher is strong enough on crime. But he’s a nice seeming kinda guy who wants affordable housing (defined in the more left-wing way) and to ban the city from buying… water bottles? I can’t endorse him, but I can see how a center-leftist might be fine with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;District 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;District 4&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really a soft endorsement for me, and if you decided not to vote for Virginia Maloney I couldn’t blame you. Virginia is another “best option” who still kinda seems to suck. She talks a lot about public safety, but what she seems to mean by that is… addressing the danger of e-bikes? God, people like this annoy me. Your high-level problem is not e-bikes, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She’s at least fine on infrastructure and modernizing city services. Your call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;District 19&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;District 19&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Chou wouldn’t be the end of the world, and Vickie Paladino is a bit of NIMBY. HOWEVER… Vickie has &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/08/16/nyc-pol-confronts-squatter-house-resident-who-blew-weed-at-her/"&gt;personally confronted squatters&lt;/a&gt;, which is just so unbelievably based we have no choice but to unconditionally stan. The Karen NYC needs, but probably not the Karen NYC deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/08/16/nyc-pol-confronts-squatter-house-resident-who-blew-weed-at-her/"&gt;personally confronted squatters&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;District 20&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;District 20&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some might lean toward Sandra Ung. She’s too much the NIMBY for me however, determined to maintain the “character” of Flushing — by which she means the version in which she grew up, certainly not the version before that! — and focuses too much on directing city resources toward the development of services specifically dedicated to immigrants. But she also hates litter and worked a bit on solar installation, which is kind of cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know, if you’re into it go for it I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;District 30&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;District 30&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is such a funny race. Both Alicia Vaichunas and Phil Wong worked for Bob Holden, a conservative Democrat and all around good guy who doesn’t want to endorse either candidate, because he loves them both. The candidates share most of his positions, and seem to also like each other? It’s honestly a coin toss, which is how Holden characterized the race. And a kind of rare heartwarming tale in local politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;District 46&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;District 46&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bit of a loose cannon and super radicalized after Covid, which is a big part of her story, but seems good on crime. A soft and cautious endorsement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;District 49&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;District 49&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a fun little bonus note on Kamillah: she established an inter-agency “squatter” task force. APPROVED. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 1&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A statewide amendment to the Adirondack Park / Mount Van Hoevenberg Olympic Sports Complex land deal: allowing continued use of the sports complex land and the acquisition of about 2,500 acres for the park&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A statewide amendment to the Adirondack Park / Mount Van Hoevenberg Olympic Sports Complex land deal: allowing continued use of the sports complex land and the acquisition of about 2,500 acres for the park&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the only statewide prop on the ballot this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, this facility was built a century ago, and heavily developed for the Olympics back in the 80s. But its existence is technically illegal given it’s on “forever wild” state forest. It’s nice, and people like it, and we should keep it IMO. Let’s just make it legal and do more cool shit there, which the public can enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 2&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A charter amendment for NYC: to create a fast-track review process for certain affordable housing projects, so they can be approved more quickly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A charter amendment for NYC: to create a fast-track review process for certain affordable housing projects, so they can be approved more quickly.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My read, this is going to greatly accelerate the construction of 100% affordable units across the city, with much less impact on market rate housing in a small number of neighborhoods, mostly without direct subway access. After this passes, I worry there will be no appetite to advance market rate housing as it navigates NYC’s regulatory maze. For most of the city, new developments under Prop 2 will be gifted to low-income families below 60% AMI (Area Median Income which means an increase in the population of net recipients the public will have to support, in free one bedroom apartments (minimum), forever. I am just totally opposed to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know that New York City has a goal of setting aside a full 15% of new affordable units for the homeless? &lt;em&gt;Why on earth are we doing this? &lt;/em&gt;Nobody is entitled to live for free in one of the most expensive, desirable cities in human history. And this is to say nothing of the impact such a policy will have on the community. Zohran Mamdani believes in policies that make life easier for violent criminals, which is how he recently defended his policy in favor of free buses (he says, explicitly: criminals are currently attacking bus drivers because they don’t want to pay, therefore making the ride free will end the attacks). I am not interested in policy that improves the lives of violent drug addicts at the expense of decent, productive members of society attempting to live their life in peace or raise a family in a city that increasingly makes that impossible. BY CHOICE. I’m sorry, no. No more. I’m over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Why on earth are we doing this? &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this is basically the high-level problem facing every single city in our country: policy that actually imports net recipients and even dangerous vagrants at the expense of everyone else. This traps the net recipients in place, and gradually raises — permanently — the cost to operate the city, while doing nothing to ease the cost of housing for anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Manhattan Institute seems to think some decent projects will work through the system buried within what is, to my eye, poison. And while I think a compromise of this kind is sometimes necessary (see Prop 4 below), I just do not agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Ketcham: &lt;/strong&gt;MI agrees that the vast majority of new housing should be financed and built by the private sector — New York City can never meet its supply needs without private investment. Elected leaders should strive to make more projects pencil out, reduce uncertainty, and let the market work its magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;John Ketcham: &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the practical reality is that NYC government has long built “100% affordable” housing, mostly through the federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. Congress created LIHTC in 1986 to attract more private capital for affordable developments. It’s far from perfect, but it isn’t going anywhere. LIHTC has been expanded repeatedly with bipartisan support, most recently this year under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Trump. Every big U.S. city does some LIHTC-backed construction. These developments take years to rezone and build, however, adding to the city’s supply crunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballot Proposal 2 is designed to speed up approvals for these projects, letting them move forward in neighborhoods with good access to jobs, stores, and health care — the kinds of places where families can build better lives. Ballot Proposal 2 doesn’t create new subsidies. Instead, it makes more efficient use of existing public funds by enabling developments to be built more quickly — and therefore at lower cost — by speeding up the approval process and removing the councilmember’s veto that kills rezonings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 3&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A charter amendment for NYC: to simplify and shorten the review process (via an “Expedited Land Use Review Procedure”) for modest housing and infrastructure projects.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A charter amendment for NYC: to simplify and shorten the review process (via an “Expedited Land Use Review Procedure”) for modest housing and infrastructure projects.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wonkish process simplification. Approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 4&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A charter amendment for NYC: to establish an “Affordable Housing Appeals Board” which could override (with a two-to-one vote) the City Council’s decision when the Council rejects or changes an affordable housing application.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A charter amendment for NYC: to establish an “Affordable Housing Appeals Board” which could override (with a two-to-one vote) the City Council’s decision when the Council rejects or changes an affordable housing application.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is still complicated, but an easier “yes” to swallow than a “yes” for Prop 2. This proposition would create a special board composed of the City Council Speaker, the Mayor, and whichever Borough President is relevant (depending on the neighborhood of a proposed development). The special board would then be capable of rejecting City Council decisions on housing projects with some number of affordable units set aside. This increases the power of the mayor, and we’ll see if Zohran can be trusted on his housing rhetoric (the abundance libs are saying yes! We! Can! (do communism and sane housing policy)). We’ll see. But Zohran won’t be mayor forever, which means this new board will eventually be helpful regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Prop 4 passes, three people will basically determine what housing is allowed to exist rather than 51 NYC City Councillors. Limiting the number of people responsible for a decision is always a boon to accountability. There will be no more hiding. Everyone in NYC will know who specifically is to blame for the sky-high cost of living, and who to remove from power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 5&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A charter amendment for NYC: to require the creation and maintenance of a digital city map by the Department of City Planning, modernizing how the city’s official map is kept and used.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A charter amendment for NYC: to require the creation and maintenance of a digital city map by the Department of City Planning, modernizing how the city’s official map is kept and used.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extremely wonkish lil policy change that will consolidate and digitize maps, and make changes easier. Cute. Why not. Approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ballot Proposal 6&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A charter amendment for NYC: to authorize shifting the city’s local election year (for city offices) so they align with the U.S. presidential election year (moving from odd-numbered years to even-numbered years).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A charter amendment for NYC: to authorize shifting the city’s local election year (for city offices) so they align with the U.S. presidential election year (moving from odd-numbered years to even-numbered years).&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t really care about voter turnout, as I don’t really think the average voter who can’t get their ass up on an odd year to vote is the kind of person we should cater to in elections. I also don’t think we want to further shape local elections with national political discourse, which running local races in a year Trump is on the ballot, for example, can’t help but accomplish. But consolidating elections will save the city some money, and I think it might — could possibly, we’ll see — help moderate elections somewhat, with the average “whatever” voter a little more averse to extremes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco moved the mayor’s race to the general, and it was fine. My sense is special elections, or odd year elections, seem to cut in two directions: a great way for good men to revolt against their evil government, and a great way for socialists to seize your government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, we are asking the question of “should we be biasing elections in favor of people who REALLY care about elections, or the average person who really doesn’t?” Maybe counterintuitively, I’m starting to think the latter group of people is just a less extreme kind of person in general. Let’s give it a shot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>migrants keep yuppies fed while liberals romanticize the hustle of their tired african burrito messengers, ignoring the exploitation going on behind the scenes</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Walk through Midtown at night and the story writes itself. Gas-powered mopeds idle in clusters outside the Roosevelt Hotel, their headlights cutting through steam from the street vents. Riders sit slumped over paper cups of coffee, helmets at their feet. Upstairs, people in $4,000/month apartments track their Uber Eats orders on their phones: &lt;em&gt;“Your Thai curry is six minutes away.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“Your Thai curry is six minutes away.”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in this city knows what’s going on. We just don’t say it out loud.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Prop C(atastrophe)</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/prop-catastrophe</link>
      <description>pirate wires #150 // on marc benioff’s suggestion we send federal troops to san francisco, and a reflection on prop c, his last dystopian contribution to the city</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So — shall we send in the troops?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;So — shall we send in the troops?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thick amidst the constant swirl of Californian Clown World chaos, tired now from years of dwindling state capacity and endemic crime across the Golden State, it was only natural desperate Americans would find themselves wondering if Daddy Trump could finally just &lt;em&gt;do something&lt;/em&gt; about the ongoing west coast circus. One such desperate American? Salesforce CEO and former libtard darling Marc Benioff, who praised Trump last week, and then kindly requested the National Guard be delivered to the Tenderloin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;do something&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have enough cops,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/marc-benioff-san-francisco-guard.html"&gt;said Benioff&lt;/a&gt; of the President’s suggestion he might send troops to San Francisco, “so if they can be cops, I’m all for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/marc-benioff-san-francisco-guard.html"&gt;said Benioff&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as much as the thought of jacked Marines kicking in the teeth of fentanyl dealers while blue-haired baristas seethe and cry in the streets with their cameras out warms my heart, federal intervention in local law enforcement is generally not a good idea without some very dangerous and immediate threat to the country, and a silly path for anyone in tech to take. In the first place, this is a super nebulous legal gray area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 1878, with updates in 1956, 1981, and 2021, the Posse Comitatus Act has limited the federal military’s ability to enforce domestic law, excluding the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, the Marines, and the Space Force (lol let’s go) from cracking skulls throughout the homeland. The Coast Guard isn’t covered by the law, and if a state governor invites the National Guard or the Air National Guard in for assistance, the federal government is permitted to help. But without that explicit request, the clearest path for a president to send troops into a state is the Insurrection Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, invoking the Insurrection Act is not actually as uncommon as the Trump deranged would have you believe. There have been &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_invocations_of_the_Insurrection_Act"&gt;30 invocations&lt;/a&gt; since 1808, with the last in 1992, when George Bush senior sent troops into Los Angeles to put down the Rodney King riots. But to the immediate question of San Francisco, what is the justification?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_invocations_of_the_Insurrection_Act"&gt;30 invocations&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s law enforcement in D.C., despite all panicked screeching from the pro-crime left, is unambiguously legal. Our nation’s capital is not a state, and our president controls D.C.’s National Guard. While the Insurrection Act has not yet been formally invoked in Chicago, it is clearly justifiable given the work of federal authorities has been made impossible by local violence, which has arguably been incited on purpose by the local government. Even still, Trump’s actions in the city have been challenged in court, and will now work their way through our legal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in San Francisco, where exactly is the crisis, or what federal work is now impossible? Yes, the Tenderloin is gross and dangerous. Yes, the fact that our city won’t work with ICE to deport Honduran nationals dealing fentanyl is infuriating. But roughing up a bunch of drug addicts and low-life criminals pretty obviously constitutes rudimentary policing, rather than an essential federal response to some extreme and unusual circumstance, and does not at all seem to be what the Insurrection Act is for. Then, it’s legality is also not the reason I am most wary of its invocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brief period of law enforcement under Trump will not save San Francisco. And let’s be honest with ourselves, saving San Francisco is not Trump’s goal. The president sees the city not only as a hub of left-wing idiocy (fair), but as an important symbol of the Democratic Party’s gross incompetence (okay, also fair). “Fixing” the city Democrats couldn’t, or wouldn’t, would be very attractive to Trump’s base, and no matter what he does I’m sure his actions will be framed as a victory on Fox. But let’s just say there is a victory. Let’s say, for argument’s sake, the drug dealing plummets, and the thieving plummets further. Will federal troops stand on Market Street forever? Or will they be gone in a few months? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year from Trump taking action, without a doubt, the city will be back to a state of de-facto legalized crime. This isn’t because Mayor Lurie or the city’s DA are uninterested in policing. This is because our local courts are filled with pro-crime judges who refuse to remove violent monsters from our streets, even after they’re arrested. And a year after Trump’s intervention, honestly, I think the city might be even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump’s entrance into San Francisco local politics will galvanize the leftists who ran this city for the past several decades. The Chesa Boudins of the world are presently demoralized and out of power. But the Chesa Boudins of the world have always run against a fictional version of a fascist, over-policed America. Federal troops in the city, against the city’s will, starts to tell a story men like Boudin can work with, and local politicians from the furthest extremes of the left will no longer be made to answer for their actually dystopian records. They’ll only have to run against Trump in a city that voted overwhelmingly against him. This will be a nightmare for the city’s moderates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sense is Mayor Lurie, a center-left liberal, understands this, which is why he &lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/12059728/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-sf-mayor-scrap-event-after-national-guard-comment"&gt;canceled a recent event&lt;/a&gt; with Benioff. San Francisco is finally on a slow healing trajectory, making incremental progress back towards sanity for the first time in years. Throwing Trump into our local politics like a Molotov cocktail will not revive the city. There is only one thing that can do that: an influx of good men, great companies, and smartly-allocated money. In other words, roughly the opposite outcome of Benioff’s last big foray into local politics, which is perhaps why he’s performatively overcompensating now. What, does he think we don’t remember?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I remember, bitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/12059728/salesforce-ceo-marc-benioff-sf-mayor-scrap-event-after-national-guard-comment"&gt;canceled a recent event&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2018, to wild applause from the tech-loathing left-wing press, Benioff championed Prop C as our path to end San Francisco’s homeless crisis, ushering in an enormous new tax on gross receipts for individuals and businesses with more than $50 million in revenue. Critically, the tax was assessed on gross income rather than profit, which disproportionately targeted payment processing companies like Stripe and Square with higher transaction volume and thinner margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Jack Dorsey and Patrick Collison attempted to explain in public that this would make their business in the city impossible, but this was years before new media press outlets existed to challenge the left’s monopoly over public discourse. Benioff accused the founders of simply not giving a shit about the homeless, both Patrick’s and Jack’s reputations were torched, every press outlet that covered the story championed the tax, and in a city that liked the sound of “help the homeless, eat the rich,” Benioff — a big ol’ fellow billionaire far less impacted by the tax himself — was victorious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d5f00630-e0bf-49b7-9c1c-a3f46f10618c_1202x1262.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing, our homeless &lt;a href="https://x.com/Benioff/status/1060060365193539584"&gt;have a home now&lt;/a&gt;, I learned today. Well, I guess Benioff did at least say there’s “no finish line” after insisting Prop C would solve the crisis. In any case, so far as the man — we begrudgingly admit — also represents the industry, it was a pyrrhic victory for tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/Benioff/status/1060060365193539584"&gt;have a home now&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple years ago, I wrote the full story for Pirate Wires in a piece called &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/doom-loop"&gt;Doom Loop&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/doom-loop"&gt;Doom Loop&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://piratewires.substack.com/p/doom-loop"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Doom Loop&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Doom Loop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;a href="https://piratewires.substack.com/p/doom-loop"&gt;Read full story&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Benioff and his detractors made a lot of claims in 2018, but their central claim was just the city only had a homeless problem because it didn’t have enough money. It was always obvious that Benioff was wrong, as the city already had something like $300 million a year set aside for the several thousand chronically homeless roaming the streets at the time. Providing beds and food somewhere safe and far outside the downtown drug market would not have been difficult. Our problem wasn’t money. Our problem was our city had no plan to actually solve homelessness. But we did have a lot of NGOs run by left-wing activists to feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, San Francisco’s annual budget for addressing homelessness is close to $1 billion a year. Square and Stripe have left the city. And &lt;em&gt;homelessness has increased.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;homelessness has increased.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, as the question of Benioff’s responsibility here was once again litigated on social media, both &lt;a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1977845547559157994"&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://x.com/jack/status/1978526347233247736"&gt;Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the long-term chilling effect Prop C has had on business in the city. We have never recovered from the policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1977845547559157994"&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/jack/status/1978526347233247736"&gt;Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc evolved his thinking over the years, and a year ago had this to say in public:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1c5180a8-e147-439a-9ce4-227a8ae3384a_1169x1590.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are nice words. Words are not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benioff has still not led the charge to reverse the very significant damage he did to San Francisco in an effort to please the likes of, for example, the ancient anti-tech blueanon goblin Kara Swisher, who he credits with radicalizing him on the issue, and who herself has had rather less to say about the policy’s massive, historic failure. I heard she lives in Washington D.C., now, and assume she doesn’t think much about the city she helped cripple any longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, sure, we do need troops in San Francisco. A rising population of good men with good values generating business. But the federal government is neither interested in nor capable of giving that to the city. We have to generate these things ourselves, and that starts with some honest reflection on the policies we’ve supported over the years, with some assessment of how they’ve done. Prop C is a policy that can’t be defended, and has arguably done more damage to the city than our lunatic judges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sense is Benioff wants us all to memory-hole his past disastrous political activism, and certainly he has a mixed record. The man has done plenty of good for the city. Dreamforce is a great local boon, and his recent &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/benioff-salesforce-15-billion-sf-21098774.php"&gt;$15 billion&lt;/a&gt; local investment commitment isn’t nothing. But there really can’t be any forgiveness for what he did until he publicly apologizes for Prop C, publicly apologizes to Jack Dorsey and Patrick Collison, and pours millions of dollars into a new campaign to repeal the proposition that helped trigger the city’s doom loop. Anything less is empty rhetoric, and I’ve been over the hoorah “based” posting for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/benioff-salesforce-15-billion-sf-21098774.php"&gt;$15 billion&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put your money where your mouth is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heather Cox Richardson’s Revisionist History</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/heather-cox-richardson-revisionist-history</link>
      <description>substack's top writer, a historian, tells her 2.7 million readers that trump is a dictator</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There was the time she wrote that 9/11 kicked off the Republican campaign to suppress voters. That Donald Trump, in 2016, won the White House partially by “asserting that white men should dominate women and people of color.” That Trump choosing JD as a running mate, in 2024, showed an ideology of rejecting democracy in favor of Christian nationalism had “taken over the Republican Party.” In September, she &lt;a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/september-13-2025"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/murder-is-bad"&gt;Charlie Kirk&lt;/a&gt; was shot by a right-wing, white man from a Republican, gun enthusiast family. And that &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/we-have-to-look-the-reactions-to"&gt;MAGA’s outrage&lt;/a&gt; at the shooting was a prelude to an authoritarian takeover. Budget cuts? Those are a prelude to an authoritarian takeover. Recent Supreme Court decisions? A prelude to an authoritarian takeover. Deploying troops to DC, who, as part of their marching orders, picked up trash and spread mulch around the cherry trees? A prelude to an authoritarian takeover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/p/september-13-2025"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/murder-is-bad"&gt;Charlie Kirk&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/we-have-to-look-the-reactions-to"&gt;MAGA’s outrage&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who wrote these dispatches, you may ask? An obscure leftist blogger, tucked away on Bluesky, followed by a handful of Portlandia co-op members? Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heather Cox Richardson may not be a household name, but she’s one of the most influential voices in American media. From her home in Maine, the Boston College professor has built a following of 2.7 million subscribers — that’s 1 million more people than Jimmy Kimmel’s average audience size, and just shy of the left-wing political commentator Hasan Piker’s 3 million streaming followers — who treat reading her nightly Substack, “&lt;a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/"&gt;Letters from an American&lt;/a&gt;,” as an act of patriotism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wikipedia Declares Trump an Authoritarian</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/wikipedia-declares-trump-an-authoritarian</link>
      <description>a single editor repeatedly inserted the same "authoritarian" framing into multiple wikipedia articles, creating an illusion of consensus and shaping the record that now informs chatgpt and google</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece was first published in &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://npov.substack.com/p/wikipedia-declares-trump-an-authoritarian?r=6w8vh&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPOV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This piece was first published in &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://npov.substack.com/p/wikipedia-declares-trump-an-authoritarian?r=6w8vh&amp;amp;triedRedirect=true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPOV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;NPOV&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two recent Fox News pieces, I reported that Wikipedia has quietly re-engineered the political record — beginning with the former president of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first piece is an investigation into how Wikipedia’s role as the world’s “knowledge infrastructure” translates into anti-Trump political activism — and possibly election interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the second piece, I sat down with Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger for a lengthy interview shortly after he released his “&lt;a href="https://larrysanger.org/nine-theses/"&gt;Nine Theses&lt;/a&gt;,” a series of essays examining where Wikipedia went wrong, and what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/how-wikipedia-made-trump-authoritarian"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Wikipedia’s targeting of Trump revealed that across multiple entries — including &lt;em&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Presidency of Donald Trump&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Authoritarianism in the United States &lt;/em&gt;— Wikipedia labels Trump “authoritarian” and a driver of “democratic backsliding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/how-wikipedia-made-trump-authoritarian"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Presidency of Donald Trump&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Authoritarianism in the United States &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just these terms that are repeated, but the same sentence verbatim is used in article after article to build the case. These articles each assert that Trump’s actions &lt;strong&gt;“have been described as authoritarian and contributing to democratic backsliding.”&lt;/strong&gt; This phrasing appears nearly identically across various pages, creating the illusion of consensus when in reality it originates from a handful of editors and a single recurring source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“have been described as authoritarian and contributing to democratic backsliding.”&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracing those edits revealed a pattern. One prolific user — &lt;strong&gt;BootsED &lt;/strong&gt;— repeatedly inserted the same “authoritarian” framing, almost always citing a single &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/10/trump-administration-authoritarian"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from The Guardian, published in April, titled “Fear spreads as Trump targets lawyers and non-profits in ‘authoritarian’ takedown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;BootsED &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/10/trump-administration-authoritarian"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BootsED is responsible for nearly 95 percent of an article — an article created by that same editor — titled &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targeting_of_political_opponents_and_civil_society_under_the_second_Trump_administration%23:~:text=Trump%2520undertook%2520mass%2520firings%2520of,existing%2520laws%2520prohibiting%2520such%2520actions."&gt;&lt;em&gt;Targeting of political opponents and civil society under the second Trump administration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which also pushes the “authoritarian” narrative. Seven of BootsED’s top 10 most edited articles are Trump-related.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite what appears to be clearly agenda-driven editing by BootsED, this editor is responsible for seeding the idea that the U.S. president is an “authoritarian” (or pulling the country in that direction) — an idea that has now filtered down to ChatGPT, Google, and other downstream platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Guardian&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;story has become the foundational reference for one of Wikipedia’s most politically charged claims. But the Guardian piece was not an act of independent journalism. It was produced as part of a special series funded by the Open Society Foundations (OSF), the global network founded by George Soros. In other words, an advocacy-backed media project became Wikipedia’s principal citation for defining Trump as authoritarian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Guardian piece relies heavily on commentary from Harvard professor Steven Levitsky, co-author of &lt;em&gt;How Democracies Die&lt;/em&gt;, who told the paper, “Trump has a strikingly authoritarian instinct.” What the Guardian didn’t tell readers, however, is that Levitsky is an advisor to Protect Democracy, an NGO founded by former Obama White House assistant counsel Ian Bassin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;How Democracies Die&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protect Democracy lists its campaign, “The Authoritarian Threat,” at the top of its website. It’s the only link above the fold on the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia editors’ decision to cite a Guardian article sponsored by Open Society Foundations did not take place in a vacuum. As I reported in a Pirate Wires &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/george-soros-wikipedia"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt; this January, Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), which owns and governs Wikipedia, has for years been led by individuals drawn directly from Soros-funded or Soros-linked institutions. This includes &lt;strong&gt;Eileen Hershenov&lt;/strong&gt;, the longtime former Open Society Foundations general counsel who later became WMF general counsel; &lt;strong&gt;Ethan Zuckerman&lt;/strong&gt;, who served not only on OSF’s Global Board (alongside George Soros and Alex Soros) but also chaired its Information Program, and later joined Wikimedia’s Advisory Board; former OSF Fellow &lt;strong&gt;Rebecca MacKinnon &lt;/strong&gt;who is now Wikimedia’s Vice President for Global Advocacy — and many others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/george-soros-wikipedia"&gt;piece&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Eileen Hershenov&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ethan Zuckerman&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, George Soros personally donated $2 million to the Wikimedia Endowment. “My gift represents a commitment to the ideals of open knowledge,” Soros said, referencing his political philosophy that revolves around building what he calls open societies, “and to the long-term importance of free knowledge sources that benefit people around the world.” Then-executive director Katherine Maher praised his “deep commitment to supporting openness in all its forms.” Watch my &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/mLsq-A4H06s"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Exclusive Interview: Wikipedia Co-founder Larry Sanger&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I sat down for a lengthy interview with Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger, his assessment was that what began as an open collaboration among volunteers has become a “bureaucracy” in which a small number of insiders dictate what counts as truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what Larry told me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wikipedia simply represents as the consensus position whatever the most powerful people on the platform say is the case. If it really represents a consensus of anything, it is the consensus of everyone who thinks in the approved way, which is a very narrow sort of consensus, like a scientific consensus. The way that Wikipedia seemed to think of scientific consensus is simply an average of the views that can be found in very few journals and excludes the views of a lot of, you might call them dissenting scientists, as if they didn’t even exist. It is very problematic, and it is the reverse of a consensus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is very problematic, and it is the reverse of a consensus.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of Wikipedia is a worldview Larry calls the “GASP consensus” (Globalist, Academic, Secular, Progressive). He described how Wikipedia’s “reliable sources” policy, once a practical guideline for quality control, has hardened into an ideological filter: only establishment outlets are allowed to define reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, Larry spoke to the dangers of having a tiny group of around 62 highly powerful, but anonymous, power users making the most decision on the site. These users include the site’s Bureaucrats (who can deputize new admins), CheckUsers (who have access to user data like IP addresses), and ArbCom (the site’s “Supreme Court”). This “Power 62,” as Larry calls them, have immense control but little accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanger’s warning is not abstract. Wikipedia’s power extends far beyond its website: its content feeds search engines, classroom materials, and the AI models that increasingly mediate what people know.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Never Bet Against America</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/never-bet-against-america</link>
      <description>why the united states is geographically overpowered</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The United States of America is the richest country on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5a3c6e6e-80d0-4c14-ab32-af1121f529dd_2048x1446.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons for this. First, the U.S. systematically attracted more immigrants than any other developed country. Second, its GDP per capita is the highest in the world among big countries. It surpassed all other empires sometime in the late 1800s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d367d33f-c714-411d-943e-e56dba9000c4_2048x1773.png"/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Some countries are richer than the US per capita, but these &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita"&gt;&lt;em&gt;are all&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;are all&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt; either tiny tax havens (Ireland and the city-states of Bermuda, Monaco, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Cayman Islands, and Singapore) or countries with massive natural endowments (Norway with oil, Iceland with geothermal energy and fish).&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the U.S. has followed an uncanny trend of nearly two percent growth in per capita GDP for over two centuries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7784c256-1933-47e8-bb42-3470cccac7cf_2048x1755.png"/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You can go back to the 1650s and see a similar trend. In the late 1700s and early 1800s, it did slow down a bit, which is understandable given two wars against the UK.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt; are we so rich?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some believe it’s the result of democracy, rule of law, the U.S. dollar, a strong military, an entrepreneurial culture… but what if these factors are threatened, as many believe they are now? Will the U.S. keep growing or fall due to mismanagement? Will China surpass it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/937d92e1-6004-4b59-8251-13e5a5065b87_2048x1478.png"/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The US has gone from 31% of world GDP in 1960 to 22% in 2023.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for the U.S., it sits on the most advantaged piece of land in the world — and this is not changing anytime soon, so its power will likely keep growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s why geography is the United States’ superpower.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Fascist “Looksmaxxers” WIRED Warned You About</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-fascist-looksmaxxers-wired-warned</link>
      <description>a closer look at the self-care touting tiktokers who are allegedly ushering in eugenics</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fellas, is looking good literally fascism? In an important new piece, as America’s troubled young men descend ever further into the internet badlands, WIRED raises one of the great questions of this moment. Shocked by this — again, important — new story, Pirate Wires set our own Riley Nork out to explore this terrifying new trend.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fellas, is looking good literally fascism? In an important new piece, as America’s troubled young men descend ever further into the internet badlands, WIRED raises one of the great questions of this moment. Shocked by this — again, important — new story, Pirate Wires set our own Riley Nork out to explore this terrifying new trend.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Solana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;—Solana&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the uninitiated, the trend looks like normal adolescent behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fixation on appearance, fitness, and hygiene, presumably in an effort to pick up members of the opposite sex, albeit through unconventional means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in reality, the trend — known as “looksmaxxing,” popular on platforms like TikTok, where young men regularly post videos of themselves doing jaw exercises, skin care routines, and other self-care practices — is far more sinister than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they may seem innocuous, lying behind every “How to Get a Chad Jawline in Two Weeks” video is nothing short of…&lt;em&gt; the emergence of fascist eugenics in America&lt;/em&gt;. Or at least, that’s according to a recent (insane) &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-of-a-black-looksmaxxer/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from Wired — the tech outlet that used to cover tech — which sounded the alarm about the hate and misogyny prevalent in this online community of dudes documenting their self-improvement journeys, basing their argument almost exclusively on &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; minority looksmaxxers receiving some hateful comments online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt; the emergence of fascist eugenics in America&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-of-a-black-looksmaxxer/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Many of the movement’s aims align with the wave of manosphere ideology that is reanimating American society under the Trump administration, where hypermasculinity has become both a performance and a weapon of oppression,” the author writes of teenagers plucking their eyebrows, adding that looksmaxxers “often use eugenic beauty standards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horrified, I decided to expand on Wired’s baseless fearmongering sensational reporting, taking a closer look at some of the specific tactics employed by these chiseled, Hitler Youth of TikTok who clearly intend to bring about an Aryan Ethnostate in America one jaw exercise at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, an investigation into the online fascist dogwhistling known as “looksmaxxing” — and why we all must remain on high alert before these well-groomed teenagers on social media destroy the concept of democracy as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>You Can’t Just Call People a Nazi Because You’re Mad</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/david-heinemeier-hansson-ruby-petition-nazi-permission-slip-violence</link>
      <description>every few years, the same sad contingent of ruby on rails malcontents tries to cancel me. but now that the usual threats aren't working, they're upping the ante</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the early 2000s, the entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson (DHH) created Ruby on Rails, an open-source set of tools for building apps. In the years since, GitHub, Shopify, Airbnb, and early Twitter — plus who knows how many startups — were all built on Rails, and upwards of 300,000 developers use the framework professionally.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, roughly 0.04% of said developers are very unhappy with DHH.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;However, roughly 0.04% of said developers are very unhappy with DHH.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last week, about 140 people in the Rails community (who DHH recently called a “sad contingent” of malcontents) published a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Plan-Vert/open-letter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;petition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to “cut ties with DHH” because of his “racist and transphobic views, as well as a number of other traits undesirable in any figurehead and community leader.” Practically speaking, the group wants to “hard fork Rails,” meaning take the existing open-source code, copy it, and start a new thing. But really, the intention here is to “cancel” DHH, making him a persona non grata, and generally punish him for his “toxic” opinions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s more, the petitioners have branded their campaign Plan Vert, a reference to, as they put it, “a railway sabotage campaign by the French resistance during WW2.” Playing out this metaphor, that would make DHH literally Hitler. So, doing my journalistic due diligence over Signal, I asked DHH is he is, in fact, a Nazi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Most certainly no 😄&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The activists probably won’t be successful in banishing DHH from the Rails ecosystem. But, as he writes in the following essay, originally published as two &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/we-ve-all-had-enough-of-this-nonsense-8545dd26"&gt;&lt;em&gt;posts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, labeling people as Nazis can have a more lasting and insidious effect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last loonies on tech’s woke island are getting desperate. It used to be that a wide variety of baseless accusations of racism, misogyny, or white supremacy could inflict grave social and professional consequences for the accused, but that’s &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-spells-are-spent-beaa675b"&gt;no longer true&lt;/a&gt;. So now they’ve had to up the ante, and that’s why &lt;a href="https://x.com/LundukeJournal/status/1970703325357387973"&gt;everyone is suddenly a Nazi&lt;/a&gt; to these people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://x.com/LundukeJournal/status/1970703325357387973"&gt;everyone is suddenly a Nazi&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because if you can’t intimidate people into silence and compliance with the woke orthodoxies by threatening their job or their social circle, you might be able to &lt;a href="https://x.com/LundukeJournal/status/1969043981188149746"&gt;threaten them with actual violence or worse&lt;/a&gt;. That’s what the “Nazi” accusation is there to convey: That violence has been authorized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/LundukeJournal/status/1969043981188149746"&gt;threaten them with actual violence or worse&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slogan has been around for a while: Punch a Nazi. It has a sorta quaint, winking phrasing, so you’d be forgiven for thinking that maybe it wasn’t actually meant as a real threat. But I think that theory has gone out the window. Just look at what happened to Charlie Kirk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a natural consequence of all the lost terrain. The DEI bureaucracies in tech have been decimated or dismantled. The tone-setting social media, X, can no longer be wielded for narrative control (and &lt;a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-bluesky-ization-of-the-american"&gt;Bluesky keeps shrinking&lt;/a&gt; from purity purges). And finally, the American administration went from blue to red in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-bluesky-ization-of-the-american"&gt;Bluesky keeps shrinking&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lost terrain means lost leverage. Which means the usual threats have stopped working because they relied on that institutional and broad social leverage to be effective. And these loonies know that.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Case for Insane Asylums</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-case-for-insane-asylums</link>
      <description>a recounting of recent attacks by the insane, a history of america’s attempts to deal with severe mental illness, and an argument for the return of long-term psychiatric institutionalization</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The brutal murder of Iryna Zarutska began a national conversation on mental illness — a problem every one of us, in every city in this country, is intimately acquainted with because tens of thousands of violent lunatics roam our streets today more or less unchecked. There is no cure for most of what we see out there, there is no longer any easy path to conservatorship, and the problem is now sufficiently bad there is no tolerating the status quo. It’s time to bring back asylums.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The brutal murder of Iryna Zarutska began a national conversation on mental illness — a problem every one of us, in every city in this country, is intimately acquainted with because tens of thousands of violent lunatics roam our streets today more or less unchecked. There is no cure for most of what we see out there, there is no longer any easy path to conservatorship, and the problem is now sufficiently bad there is no tolerating the status quo. It’s time to bring back asylums.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obviously, the subject is fraught. Civil libertarians believe the chaos on our streets is just the cost of freedom, while many well-meaning liberals believe the problem just a matter of our government refusing to fund treatments for mental illness that literally do not exist. The big missing piece of the conversation is, I think, a history. How did we get here? What has been tried? What is the reality on the ground? And how do we move forward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—Solana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;—Solana&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iryna Zarutska was stabbed three times on August 22nd of 2025 while sitting quietly on Charlotte’s LYNX Blue Line, an integral part of the state’s light-rail commuter system. Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr., unprovoked, plunged a folding knife into her throat. He did this two more times in rapid succession. Zarutska looked up at him in terror, visibly petrified and confused, blood spilling out of her neck. She then covered her face with her hands, remaining conscious for nearly a minute before sliding off of her chair and onto the floor of the train. Brown wrapped his hand in a sweater and walked away. Iryna was pronounced dead at the scene. All of this was captured on security cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A particular still from this footage has become central in the story’s coverage. It shows Zarutska looking down at her phone and making herself very small in her chair. Her arms are pulled close across her body, her knees are touching. She is in the sort of physical position that one now tends to assume when in unavoidable public proximity with a person whom one senses to be mentally unstable. Whose attention is easily drawn, and whose unpredictable set of potential reactions ranges from silent shuffling to incoherent and aggressive yelling to spontaneous, life-threatening violence. Brown is looming behind her in this image, arm raised, knife in hand, midway through the swing of his first stabbing motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown walked off the scene unimpeded, a dotted trail of blood following behind him, through two train cars filled with bystanders. No one came to Zarutska’s aid until one minute and thirty-six seconds after the attack. Some have attributed these facts to a growing collective callousness toward the suffering of others. I believe, however, that they originate not from a place of indifference, but of practiced inattention, one that is a logical consequence of public policy. These bystanders were instinctually aware of Brown’s mental instability, accustomed to dealing with the presence of such people, and engaging in the rational set of avoidant behaviors. The purposeful staring at nothing, metaphorical blinders on, body language signaling non-confrontational dispositions. Iryna was making herself very small in her chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now routine in American cities to come into contact with folks who are some combination of severely mentally ill, homeless, perennially criminal, and substance-abusing. Most of these people are not dangerous. Some of them are. The almost limitless tolerance of their disruptive presence in common society is a choice that we have made, one that hides behind the nebulous defense of “empathy as policy”¹ while fomenting destructive conditions. We have largely failed to engage with this problem for several decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown’s case highlights this negligence in striking fashion. He had been arrested fourteen times for a litany of violent and nonviolent offenses before murdering Zarutska. This is one of the most-reported-on facts of the story, a source of understandable outrage, and a primary representation of the failure of “empathy as policy” in the criminal justice system — a pattern of imaginary thinking in which endless second chances and empty hand-waving about transformative reformation dominate. Anyone with Brown’s sort of track record should, quite obviously, be removed from society for the preemptive good of all parties involved. This requires long-term incarceration or institutionalization, neither of which were demanded of or granted to Decarlos Brown. (With the caveat that he previously served a six-year prison sentence for armed robbery from 2015 to 2020, which is in many senses “long-term,” though clearly neither sufficiently long nor reformative.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the term “granted” here, in reference to long-term institutionalization, because of a number of lesser-known facts about Decarlos Brown. Michelle Dewitt, his mother, with whom he had been living after his 2020 prison release, had attempted multiple times to get her son committed to a mental institution. He is a diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic, was growing increasingly aggressive at home, and would pace the room while having heated conversations with invisible participants. Dewitt took her son to a mental hospital, but they did not have space for Brown, who was, in any case, refusing voluntary commitment. The hospital informed Dewitt that if he was not “trying to kill himself or someone else,” she would need a court order to have him committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dewitt then went through the legal process of petitioning the court, demonstrating successfully that her son met the criteria for involuntary commitment. The civil order was granted, and Brown was remanded to a mental health facility for the stunningly meager duration of 14 days. He stopped taking his medication soon after returning to his mother’s house. Dewitt and her husband eventually dropped him off at the Roof Above Lucille Giles Men’s Shelter, no longer able to abide him in their home, and Decarlos began living on the streets. In January of 2025, he went to Novant Hospital, seeking help and claiming that he was afflicted with some “man-made material that controlled when he ate, walked, and talked.” The hospital was unable to accommodate him, and the police became involved. Officers told Brown that there was nothing they could do, which greatly upset Brown, who proceeded to call 911 to request further assistance. He was arrested for “misuse of the 911 system” before being released without bond back into the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After killing Zarutska, Brown called his sister from jail. “The material did it… whoever was working the materials, they lashed out on her,” he said. “They just lashed out on her, that’s what happened.” He then added, “I never said not one word to the lady at all. That’s scary, ain’t it. Why would somebody stab somebody for no reason?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown’s murder of Zarutska is, of course, not the only such case of severely mentally ill wanderers unleashing unprovoked violence on unsuspecting members of the general public. On October 4th, 2021, Anthonia Egegbara — a 29-year-old homeless and schizophrenic woman whose family had tried repeatedly to get her professional help — pushed Lenny Javier into an oncoming Times Square subway train. On January 15th, 2022, at 9:30 in the morning, Michelle Go was pushed in front of an oncoming R train at a New York City subway stop by Martial Simon, a 61-year-old homeless man and diagnosed schizophrenic who had been in and out of various institutions for 20 years (and who, notably, told a psychiatrist in 2017 that it was “only a matter of time” before he shoved a woman onto the tracks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May 21st, 2023, at the Lexington Avenue and 63rd Street stop, Kamal Semrade grabbed the head of Emine Ozsoy with two hands and, according to a witness account, “mushed her head — not her body — into the train. She just tumbled, just kept spinning because the train kept hitting her. You could see the white inside [the flesh in her face], that’s how bad it was.” March 25th, 2024, Carlton McPherson snuck up behind Jason Volz and pushed him onto the subway tracks at 125th Street and Lexington Avenue. McPherson had been hospitalized several times in two years before this incident, for artifacts of severe mental illness, and his brother Daquan insisted their family had “repeatedly tried to ensure he remained in psychiatric care.” Daquan “begged them to keep him, but they said he wasn’t a threat to himself or others… and they let him go.” McPherson was released two weeks before killing Jason Volz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cohort of examples consists only of New York City subway-pushings that occurred in the last five years, were perpetrated by homeless people with evidence of severe mental illness, and were entirely unprovoked. Even within this limited scope, I am unable to cover the list comprehensively for fear of turning this piece into a morose droning-on — at least 25 people were pushed onto NYC subway tracks in 2024 alone. (Obviously, many of these do not fit the precise shape pertinent to this discussion, but the point has been made.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also just one city’s subset of &lt;em&gt;extreme &lt;/em&gt;examples: any person who has spent meaningful time in a major American metropolis has had, at minimum, one nontrivially unnerving encounter with someone who is aggressively mentally unstable. The consequences of tolerating free-range lunatics, a colorful phrase which I invoke here with no pejorative ill-will, reach far beyond the hyper-acute hazard of being literally murdered. Why do we accept the ubiquity of this on-edge, unsafe feeling, the ceding of the character of public spaces to a small minority of profoundly suffering individuals who lack the wherewithal to operate safely in society?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;extreme &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incredible systemic failure is institutional and cultural: the mid-20th-century demolition of American insane asylums, whose initial construction and eventual destruction were both functions of ill-fated empathy, left us without a viable option for the preemptive and humane isolation of these disturbed individuals. We then filled this institutional void with coping mechanisms, namely a persistent delusion that our secular powers of criminal and psychiatric reform were limitless, sparing ourselves the difficult work of dealing with reality (at the expense of allowing the festering of this proverbial rat’s nest). Endless strings of repetitive catch-and-release prison stints. Short-term, and therefore futile, psychiatric confinements, limited by infrastructural capacity. Permanent, rampant, inhumane homelessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not that we are refusing to cure the severely mentally ill out of disdain, or apathy, but that we lack the medical ability to do so. Anti-psychotic pills, even if taken religiously, which they rarely are, fall far short of being reason-restoring. They also come with a laundry list of brutal, and common, side effects: painful muscle contractions, severe weight gain, new-onset diabetes, nausea, insomnia, chronic involuntary movements. A refusal to grant these individuals long-term institutionalization, therefore, amounts to nothing less than a surrendering of the public to insanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, as part of his larger Agenda 47, Trump vowed to “open large parcels of inexpensive land, bring in doctors, psychiatrists, social workers, and drug rehab specialists, and create tent cities where the homeless can be relocated and their problems identified.” For those deemed “severely mentally ill and deeply disturbed,” he planned to “bring them back to mental institutions, where they belong, with the goal of reintegrating them back into society once they are well enough to manage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in July of 2025, Trump signed an executive order entitled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets” that, among other things, directed the Attorney General to expand the use of involuntary non-criminal commitment for those who are homeless and suffering from severe mental illness — to make it legally easier to preemptively isolate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, when asked in a September 2025 interview if he would be amenable to the idea of “the government reopening insane asylums for people with serious mental illness,” Trump replied, “Yeah, I would… they used to have them, and you never saw people like we had… they released them all into society because they couldn’t afford it… you can’t have these people walking around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slippery-slope-fearers are naturally, and perhaps fairly, wary of this proposed pro-reinstitutionalization trajectory. There are obvious due process and civil rights concerns associated with the forcible removal of people from society based not on criminal convictions, but on potentially subjective evaluations of their mental states. This is a heated conversation even in the case of modern conservatorships established and led by family members, à la &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/mad-world"&gt;the Britney Spears situation&lt;/a&gt;, let alone hypothetical widespread, state-initiated asylum lockups. A preemptive assumption that this person will harm themselves or others has to be made with enough certainty to strip them of their autonomy. The hairiness of this territory, however, rather than discouraging us from searching for potential solutions, should be seen as a call to continue (and retrospectively learn from) a conversation that has been happening in America since our prenatal days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/mad-world"&gt;the Britney Spears situation&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Francis Fauquier, the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia from 1758 until his death in 1768, wrote the following a decade before the Declaration of Independence was signed: “It is expedient that I should also recommend to your Consideration and Humanity a poor unhappy Set of People who are deprived of their Senses, and wander about the Country, terrifying the Rest of their Fellow Creatures. A legal Confinement, and proper Provision, ought to be appointed for these miserable Objects… to endeavour to restore to them their lost Reason.” A year later, he expressed concern that, given the lack of progress on resolving this issue, he was “compelled to the daily commission of an illegal act, by confining, without any authority, a poor lunatick who, if set at liberty, would be mischievous to society.” Nine years later, America was born, the “unalienable rights” phrase was printed, and the unsolved problem of these wanderers remained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1700s and early 1800s, confinement of the severely mentally ill was widespread and unofficial, driven by social and carceral forces. Families would hide their mentally ill relatives away out of shame, and those without accommodating families would be subject to imprisonment in local jails (crimeless or otherwise, as Fauquier noted). Still others were relegated to workhouses and almshouses, many of which had designated sections for insane occupants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enlightenment ideals of the moral restoration of Reason to the Reasonless began making their way into the American psyche, birthing early insane asylums like the 1813 Friends Asylum in Philadelphia. These institutions remained small and rare, however, through the 1840s, at which time activist Dorothea Dix began documenting the horrific conditions of informal confinement facing the severely mentally ill. Dix wrote of people in cages, naked and chained, packed into cells without regard for their well-being. She was the most prominent torch-bearer of this new wave of public empathy for the disavowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dix, in 1843, petitioned the Massachusetts legislature to expand the Worcester State Lunatic Hospital. Having toured the pertinent jails and almshouses, witnessing the torturous and immoral treatment of the severely mentally ill in informal confinement, and believing in the promise of formal asylums, she wrote the following: “I come to place before the Legislature of Massachusetts the condition of the miserable, the desolate, the outcast. I come as the advocate of helpless, forgotten, insane men and women; of beings sunk to a condition from which the unconcerned world would start with real horror.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, Dix’s calls for society to “restore the outcast” and “defend the helpless” spread like cultural wildfire. By the end of the 1840s, eleven of the original thirteen states had built asylums. In the 1850s came the “Kirkbride Plan,” developed by Dr. Thomas Story Kirkbride, which outlined a standardized approach to asylum construction — natural light, maximal air circulation, well-maintained grounds, and a patient limit to prevent overcrowding. This directly led to the construction of an additional seventy-eight American insane asylums; the plight of the insane had been heard. There was great optimism that these institutions would end the terrors of informal confinement, cure the disturbed with moral treatment — a regimen of kindness, dignity, structured routine, and open spaces — and reintegrate many of them back into society. Progressive empathy would be backed by effective institutions and transformative collective action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, unfortunately, not what happened. Moral treatment did not work, and viable medical approaches were nonexistent. By the 1870s, overcrowding was rampant. It was apparent by 1900 that our powers of psychiatric restoration had been greatly overestimated, and that these asylums looked a lot like rebranded versions of the informal confinements which had horrified Dix and her public 50 years prior. Beatings, restraints, cruel and inhumane conditions. Our eyes (empathetic passions) were proven much larger than our stomachs (pragmatic capacity to enact lasting change), and society once again turned against lunatics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the 20th century pre-1950s was largely characterized by “custodial care” — the begrudged warehousing of severely mentally ill patients in brutal conditions, in grossly underfunded asylums — and the emergence of overtly violent medical “treatments.” One asylum in Buffalo, designed to hold 600 patients, was housing 3,600. Insulin shock therapy, deliberately inducing comas in mental patients via insulin overdosing, was widespread. Metrazol shock therapy used pharmaceuticals to cause seizure-like convulsions of such intensity that 43 percent of patients undergoing the treatment suffered vertebral fractures. Walter Freeman developed the transorbital lobotomy, in which a picklike instrument is forced through the back of the eye socket to sever parts of the brain and enfeeble patients, a procedure so efficient that he was able to personally lobotomize 228 patients over one 12-day span. Nearly 19,000 lobotomies were performed in the United States by 1951. Treatments like these were often used as a means of control, to make overcrowded asylums more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;100-plus years after Dorothea Dix’s crusade, cyclical empathy having made its rounds, the plight of the severely mentally ill once again took center-stage. An early turning point was Albert Maisel’s “Bedlam 1946,” a written exposé of two insane asylums — one in Pennsylvania and one in Ohio — that detailed horrific conditions, much like Dix had done before him, and was coupled with grueling photographic evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But history is linear and does not “repeat itself” as such. This brings us to the 1950s. Institutionalization, in the form of insane asylums, had failed miserably. Informal confinement had proven inhumane, as had formal confinement, and no moral or medical cure for the deeply deranged had been produced. Where was left for a troubled society to turn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus began the multi-decade process of deinstitutionalization, which would lead to the end of insane asylums, the mass release of severely mentally ill individuals into society, and today’s commensurate end-state of public disarray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1954, an anti-psychotic drug called Thorazine received FDA approval. Within eight months of hitting the market, it was administered to two million patients, and became widely available for use at asylums. The existence of an anti-psychotic pill that was even marginally effective was revolutionary, and it made appealing the concept of outpatient treatment for the severely mentally ill. The 1950s, an age of futuristic optimism, had yielded the beginnings of a cure for insanity! Common conception was that, of course, progress on the clinical restoration of Reason would continue, if not accelerate. How could it not? The insane asylum population peaked in 1955 at around 559,000 patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the aforementioned Dr. Walter Freeman, notorious purveyor of lobotomies? Rosemary Kennedy, the sister of future president John F. Kennedy, was lobotomized in 1941 by that very same Dr. Freeman. The operation resulted in Rosemary, then 23, having the diminished mental capacity of a two-year-old child. This greatly affected JFK, who, in 1963, delivered a “Special Message to the Congress on Mental Illness and Mental Retardation,” asserting that the “reliance on the cold mercy of custodial isolation will be supplanted by the open warmth of community concern and capability.” This marked, quite directly, an empathy-driven return to placing this major societal burden of the severely mentally ill on imaginary empathic “community” shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy signed the Community Mental Health Act of 1963 23 days before he was assassinated. The plan called for 1,500 community mental health centers which, no doubt inspired by the promise of drugs like Thorazine, would provide outpatient care and begin to replace custodial asylums. Federal grants funded the construction, but not the operation, of these community centers. Fewer than half were ever built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil rights movement served to intensify this anti-institutionalization surge. These patients were seen as unfairly oppressed, their rights clearly violated. Ken Kesey’s &lt;em&gt;One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest &lt;/em&gt;(1962) further contributed to (rightful) negative perceptions around asylum conditions. (The 1975 movie had significantly wider reach and later contributed even further to a culture of deinstitutionalization.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medicaid, established in 1965, included something called the “Institutions for Mental Diseases” (IMD) exclusion. This, in line with the spirit of the Community Mental Health Act, prohibited federal Medicaid funding for care provided to adults in psychiatric facilities with more than 16 beds, a fatal blow to insane asylums. These facilities were insanely expensive to operate, even understaffed and overcrowded, were facing major cultural headwinds, and would need to be financially supported exclusively by state governments. (Who, by the way, were promised financial incentives in the other direction for transitioning to community-centric, outpatient-led, non-custodial care models via Kennedy’s 1963 legislation). The IMD exclusion remains active today, fundamentally unchanged from its original wording. (As of a March 2024 revision, Medicaid covers up to 30 days per year of substance use disorder treatment, specifically, in qualifying mental institutions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1955, there were 166 million people in the United States and at least 559,000 patients in long-term psychiatric institutions. Today, there are nearly 350 million people in the United States and only 37,000 patients in state psychiatric hospitals. (There are an additional 60,000 private psychiatric beds, but they are occupied predominantly by voluntary patients whose health insurance covers the costs of their brief stays, as nearly all civil and criminal court-mandated patients are sent to state facilities.) If we were to institutionalize, proportionally, the same number of people today as we did in 1955, that would translate to 1.2 million patients. We have 37,000 state beds. Of these, more than half are occupied by “forensic patients” — individuals who have already been charged with crimes and are either undergoing evaluation or have been dubbed Incompetent to Stand Trial (IST), Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity (NGRI), or Guilty but Mentally Ill (GBMI). The other 48 percent of patients, civil patients, are held on average for fewer than two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr. is currently being held for evaluation in one of these state facilities as a “forensic patient.” Before the stabbing, when his mother’s legal petition was granted and he was remanded to one of these facilities for 14 days, he was on the &lt;em&gt;long end&lt;/em&gt; of a civil stay. Not only do we not have room for the preemptive isolation of the &lt;em&gt;potentially &lt;/em&gt;dangerous severely mentally ill people among us, we, in fact, don’t even have room for the &lt;em&gt;criminally insane&lt;/em&gt;. Those inmates, e.g. those who are NGRI, spend a median of two months in jail before there is even a psychiatric bed available for them. This pressure, of course, necessitates the rapid discharge of civil patients from state psychiatric facilities, many of whom will inevitably return as forensic patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;long end&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;potentially &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;criminally insane&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, as a country, completely lack the institutional infrastructure needed to deal with the particular brand of severe mental illness — and its natural comorbidities — with which we are afflicted. Nontrivially unnerving encounters with horrifyingly unstable people are routine in American cities because we, by our own series of choices, have abandoned these folks to a repetitive pinballing between homelessness, short-term psychiatric holds, and jail. This is an inhumanity which puts innocents at risk and unacceptably deteriorates our social fabric. Frighteningly, our best solution, barring the invention of a miracle panacea for mental derangement or the construction of additional infrastructure, seems to be indefinitely jailing these people once some yet-to-be-formalized threshold of pertinent convictions has been met. A version of our early 19th-century approach. Because, again, we do not yet have a cure for the severely, violently mentally ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is not an aspirational enough end-game for the United States of America, the wealthiest and most powerful country on earth, in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard problems are always messy. Dealing with them inevitably involves taking on risk and making difficult, calculated tradeoffs. The only definitively wrong answer here, which appears to be our chosen solution, is to not engage. To act on empathy with one hand and to cover our eyes with the other, so as to imagine a better result than the one we have actually wrought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the failure to address this elephant in the room, I fear, is a sense that we lack the governmental competence to build much of anything — let alone a new network of modern insane asylums that will avoid the sprawling pitfalls of its 19th and 20th-century predecessors. Instead, it is easier to foolishly pretend that someone like Decarlos Brown will be magically healed by an outpatient psychiatric pill prescription, or to believe that our carceral system will miraculously reform him after his fourteenth arrest-and-release, or to imagine that his fractured familial support network will come together and eventually be able to manage him safely without meaningful aid from the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebuild the insane asylums. Call them “Psychiatric Institutes,” but know what they are. Isolate those who need to be isolated, and find a way to do it humanely. Continue to strive to understand the spiritual and chemical concoctions whose balances separate Reason from Reasonless, sanity from insanity, and aim to cure as many afflicted souls as possible. What looks now like a surrendering of the public to the whims of deeply disturbed wanderers can become an opportunity for change, a testament to our ability to construct incredible institutions, a credit not to just our moral sense, but to our ability to follow through on the pragmatic machinations of turning visions into reality. Admitting that a problem is beyond the reach of our resolve has never been the American modus operandi, and a situation as important as this one must not remain neglected for craven fear of failure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Waymo Nationalism</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/waymo-nationalism</link>
      <description>a brief history of clownery against cute, unassuming autonomous vehicles — and why waymo always wins</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In late August, Waymo quietly unleashed eight vehicles onto New York City streets. Each one had a human chaperone, because New York City law requires it (for now). Back in July, I saw an early test vehicle driving up Avenue B, quietly mapping the city’s streets — it was just one car in a cute, unassuming reconnaissance unit, basically preparing the city for the coming army (of Waymos). A few people stopped to stare (I definitely did) but most just politely ignored it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxi and Uber drivers, though? They &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this summer, they made it known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cancer starts with a dot and then it spreads,” said Fernando Mateo, leader of the Federation of Taxi Drivers, a lobbying group, with a group of protesters outside the Governor’s office. “[Waymo] is a cancer to us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Independent Drivers Guild, a union of Uber and Lyft drivers, railed against the mayor for turning New Yorkers into “lab rats for Silicon Valley investors” — though Waymo paid the city a flat $5k fee to start testing (not a big investment, lol), and most New Yorkers are either ambivalent or eager to ride in one. And then, in what to me was the most… let’s say, inventive… argument at this protest, Mateo said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of cab drivers that have saved people committing suicide. You have a human being that you can actually share your thoughts with. You can’t do that with a robot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waymos, jfyi, are 80 percent safer than cars driven by people. Mateo’s argument is that more people should die in car accidents so the lives of a few very distraught people can be saved by those saintly cabbies you only really see on &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt;, the kind who ask you why you’re not married yet and when you last called your mom, the imaginary and mystical Uncs of New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If history is any guide, we’ll see more of these protests, and ever more creative arguments against what I believe is inevitable. Already, I’ve heard that New York City just “isn’t built” for self-driving cars, that New Yorkers will get “too lonely” while being driven home from the club, that Waymos can’t survive snow, that the company will never surmount New York State’s legal hurdles.¹ And, of course, I’ve heard that the AVs will kill us. All of which is to say: Waymo’s rise in NY will be long, and clownish, and turbulent. Or maybe, idk, it’ll go super smoothly and New Yorkers will peacefully accept their fate (beautiful, clean autonomous vehicles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt it, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, when Waymo and Cruise² first hit San Francisco streets, a group of activists by the name of “Safe Street Rebels” figured out all you had to do to confuse a Waymo was place a &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/labors-shadow-war-self-driving-cars"&gt;traffic cone&lt;/a&gt; on its hood. The lidar sensor would detect the tip of the cone and, unable to tell whether the cone was actually &lt;em&gt;in its path&lt;/em&gt; or if its detection system was malfunctioning, it would stop in its tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/labors-shadow-war-self-driving-cars"&gt;traffic cone&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;in its path&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so they began popping out of bushes to do this, under cover of night. Sometimes they’d cause minor traffic jams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Baby’s first cone!” one of the Safe Street Rebels said after coning for the first time. “It’s so fun. Just a little pushback against a big movement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ostensibly they were advocating for public transportation. They hated that instead of high-speed rail, California was investing in more cars (I do get this argument). They were also opposed to surveillance (even by 2022, Waymo had responded to multiple search warrants for footage from its vehicles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lead-up to the California Public Utilities Commission’s vote on whether to allow Waymo and Cruise to expand service in the Bay Area, protesters declared “Week of Cone,” during which they went HAM on these types of attacks. No one was injured; it was performative. The Guardian published a sort of flattering &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/26/san-francisco-stop-self-driving-cars-traffic-cone-safe-street-rebel"&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; of the activists, with a photo of some dude on a bike, prowling around SF carrying a giant orange cone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/26/san-francisco-stop-self-driving-cars-traffic-cone-safe-street-rebel"&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vote went through. Waymo won. Coning became gauche. Bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years later, on Lunar New Year in 2024, someone threw a firework inside a Waymo parked on Jackson Street in San Francisco’s Chinatown. Someone else jumped the windshield. A firework was thrown into the vehicle, which caught fire and burned to the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/496ec3b5-51c0-4404-9603-c6c0cd6b0edd_1180x1188.png"/&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/SFFDPIO/status/1756581720399520077"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one knows why this happened, exactly. Probably just mob chaos. Apparently, the innocent Waymo drove straight into a crowd, executing its planned route, and the crowd stopped it, and craziness ensued. It was opportunistic violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waymo responded with a brief statement (“this was a one-off event”) and later that year, doubled its weekly paid rides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right before the Lunar New Year fiasco, a San Francisco couple was sitting inside a Waymo when a homeless-looking man walked up to their car and tried to cover its sensor at a green light. It was dark, raining. The couple just sat there, terrified. Eventually the sensor vandal went away and Waymo security arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We felt trapped in the sense that we didn’t know what to do in that instance,” one of them said. “Do we get out? Was it safe to get out of the car? We literally had no control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Waymo’s advice in this situation is to remain inside the car.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That same month, Waymo hit a cyclist in Portrero Hill. (They left the scene with minor injuries and were never hospitalized.) Waymo released a statement explaining that the cyclist drove in front of the car quicker than it could brake. Again, the cyclist was &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt; — but opposition ramped up from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration began a probe into the company a few months later, after 22 reports of Waymo violating traffic laws (mostly by lightly bumping into gates or rocks), but no serious injuries. The probe ended 14 months later, after the agency found no systemic defects or violations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last October, two men (the New York Post labeled them “catcalling bozos”) stood in front of a Waymo while someone was inside, demanding her phone number. She videotaped the entire thing. One of them takes his hat off, trying to… woo her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f1bc062d-e9c6-4918-8364-537b39de7260_1174x1448.png"/&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/Amina_io/status/1840759345354809414"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the guys leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waymo apologizes, and a few months later, they announce that service will expand to Miami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;// ARSON, ROUND 2 //&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we saw the &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/it-was-chaos-the-la-riots-a-first-hand-account"&gt;riots&lt;/a&gt; last June. Five Waymos were basically treated like burning effigies, stand-ins for everything hardcore anti-ICE protesters believe is evil: “google” “big tech” “surveillance” “technology” “automation.” I don’t really know if they were consciously thinking any of this — maybe they just wanted to burn things. Actually, that’s probably what it was, at least partially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/it-was-chaos-the-la-riots-a-first-hand-account"&gt;riots&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waymo suspended service in parts of downtown LA. A battalion of Waymos were seen fleeing LA, all in a row:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f65bc290-e20a-424c-be77-6c5abf1169ac_1294x1574.png"/&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/niccruzpatane/status/1932213788117286959"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, one week later?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service expansion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ec4f6b6f-0c18-4a69-80b5-943316a2ecb7_1449x718.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When cars first began replacing horses in the early 20th century, people mocked them as “devil wagons,” toys for the rich, symbols of capitalism running rampant. Carriage unions complained that cars were scaring horses, that cars were dangerous, would injure people (and horses) — which, I mean, cars &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;. But in exchange, we got cars. And with cars we got almost all of modern America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re at the beginning of another car vs. carriage era, though almost no one can see it — except, probably, the taxi drivers’ union, because they’re already angry. Will people lose their jobs? Yes. Will some people be injured? Will the horses be startled? Will the “devil wagons” race around Manhattan videotaping every single person on the street, and mapping the street grid as they go? Will they turn all that data over to the police? Will we be able to solve crime that much faster? Will some people hate all of this and more? Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in exchange, we’ll get self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safer, probably faster (eventually), cheaper, smarter, and cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waymo nationalism is coming, New York. Might as well accept your fate. If you don’t? We’ll probably see five years of confused autonomous vehicles bumbling around trying to dodge activists wielding cones in Times Square, but I’m pretty sure Waymo’s engineers will (eventually) win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Harris Sockel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¹ NY doesn’t allow driverless cars w/o a chaperone right now, but two bills currently making their way through the state senate aim to change this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;² Cruise, then owned by GM, caught a pedestrian and dragged them for 20 feet (terrible), after which California’s DMV suspended its permit. The company later quietly pivoted to developing software for regular cars (not fully autonomous vehicles). The woman was hospitalized, lived, and got a ~$10m payout.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Orange Alert</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/orange-alert-5f0</link>
      <description>pirate wires #149 // invasive pests and the decimation of florida’s citrus industry, china, the greater threat to u.s. agriculture, and calling for an american bioforce</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ripe for disaster. &lt;/strong&gt;Back before Covid, I had a conversation with my brother-in-law about his new backyard in Florida. “Well,” I said, “you have to get an orange tree.” Because what could be more &lt;em&gt;Florida &lt;/em&gt;than that? I imagined waking up and picking the fruit myself, barefooted, sun shining in my hair. This was just what one did, I assumed, when one crossed the border into &lt;em&gt;Florida, &lt;/em&gt;and we were a &lt;em&gt;Florida family&lt;/em&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Ripe for disaster. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Florida &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Florida, &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Florida family&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh,” said my brother-in-law, as if relaying some sad news about an acquaintance with cancer, “you don’t really see them down here anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the day I learned about the plague devastating Florida’s citrus industry, which had been raging then for something like a decade. It was a sad story, I thought, though vaguely doubting it as bad as he described it. And, in any case, it was only a temporary problem, as are all sad stories in this country. Because this is America, and in America everything works out. Then, I pretty much didn’t think about the subject for another ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But last week I randomly wondered how the state solved the crisis, which I assumed it must have done, conducted a little quick research for a brief dispatch — which, incredibly, I thought might make for a cute morning white pill — &lt;em&gt;and holy shit is Big Orange fucked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;and holy shit is Big Orange fucked.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the mid-20th Century, Florida oranges, which supplied most of the nation’s orange juice, had become much more than an agricultural product. From Walt’s branding the fruit into the identity of Disney World, which was built on orange groves, to Anita Bryant’s smiling face on television every morning imploring us to drink, oranges became a powerful symbol of American wellness, abundance, and prosperity. I myself have thought about the fruit, the kind of physical instantiation of American sunshine, in similar terms, which is probably why I’ve had such an oddly emotional reaction to news of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the industry’s hopeful predictions back in 2023, Florida orange farmers sold just a little more than 12 million boxes of fruit over the last year, a dramatic, unthinkable decline from &lt;em&gt;150 million boxes&lt;/em&gt; back in the early 2000s, or over 200 million boxes at the state’s peak in the 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;150 million boxes&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apparently intractable problem before us is an invasive pest called the Asian citrus psyllid, which spreads a bacterial infection called the “citrus greening disease,” first detected in our country back in 1998. Nothing we’ve tried has been able to stop it. But as wild and depressing as losing the citrus industry has been in its own right, the loss hints at an even greater danger. Namely, what if something similar happens to one of our staple crops like corn, wheat, or soy? It would be an unthinkable calamity, but then I didn’t think we’d lose our orange groves either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the invasive pest with a taste for wheat we aren’t paying attention to? What is the deadly fungus being redesigned in a foreign lab? And how do we defend against threats we can’t even imagine let alone see?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In America, we don’t often think about food. Or, okay, we basically never stop thinking about food, but only in an embarrassing decadent “fall of Rome” sort of way. What we don’t do is &lt;em&gt;worry&lt;/em&gt; about food. This is because we are not only living in a nation of abundant food, but a nation that has always, even in our brief moments of poverty, been relatively plentiful. Our country has more arable land than any other in the world, and has produced abundant crops and livestock across an enormous, geographically diverse continent from the founding. This mix of scale, decentralization, and resource abundance has insulated us from most systemic famine risk for as long as we’ve been able to rapidly transport goods. But over the last century, global trade has introduced a new kind of risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;worry&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this your Orange Alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida is a fascinating sort of invasive species hell. Maybe it’s the weather, warm and wet and all but inviting tropical killers from the orient or Africa. Maybe it’s the sort of… carefree spirit of the people there? I’m talking about the Florida Man, of course, a feral and Romantic archetype, imaginative, chaotic, a little meth-y sometimes if we’re being honest, and exactly the sort of person who buys exotic pets from the third world and frees them in his backyard, repeatedly, for many many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple summers ago, I wrote about this all at length &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/dominion"&gt;in a piece called Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, paying particular attention to the impact of the state’s most well-known invader:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/dominion"&gt;in a piece called Dominion&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is however no invasive species more obviously devastating — or captivating to the wild-eyed Florida Man — than the Burmese python. Just three decades after its appearance in the Everglades, across a land mass roughly twice the size of New Jersey, raccoon, bobcat, deer, and opossum populations have crashed by between &lt;a href="https://envhumanities.sites.gettysburg.edu/es225b-spring19/pythons-in-the-florida-everglades/ecological-impacts-of-the-burmese-python/#:~:text=Marsh%20rabbits%2C%20cottontail%20rabbits%2C%20and,South%20Florida%20Water%20Management%20District)."&gt;90 and 99%&lt;/a&gt;. Marsh rabbits, cottontail rabbits, and foxes have been completely eradicated. The python even eats the region’s most famous apex predator, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddAvBCsr7zw"&gt;the alligator&lt;/a&gt; (though, to their credit, the alligators &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzNiow9y9Kw"&gt;appear to eat them back&lt;/a&gt;). Today, the snake has expanded as far north as Tampa Bay, and threatens to overtake the entire American southeast.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzNiow9y9Kw"&gt;appear to eat them back&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The python is a massive problem, though not yet deadly to humans. The same is true of oranges, lush and lovely as they are — a sad loss, but a loss we can survive. Still, the Asian psyllid does introduce us to a new class of problem: invasive pests that impact agriculture at scale. As we back into this much more significant danger, it’s worth taking a moment to really understand how Florida lost its oranges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citrus greening is a bacterial infection spread by the Asian citrus psyllid, an invasive bug that feeds on citrus leaves. Once infected, fruit born by the tree becomes misshapen and bitter. For two decades now, farmers have tried and failed to stop it in a number of ways, including insecticides, tree removal, the introduction of predatory pests (a tiny little wasp called &lt;em&gt;tamarixia radiata&lt;/em&gt;), hybridizing trees and genetically modifying trees in service of making them more resistant to greening, nutrient supplements to boost tree immunity, and antibiotic treatments — which did find some limited success, but also raised a host of other issues. There has recently, just this year, been a bit of limited success in the creation of citrus greening &lt;em&gt;resistant&lt;/em&gt; orange tree varieties, which is not to say new trees that are immune, but a little more robust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;tamarixia radiata&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;resistant&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the best defense against the psyllid was to keep the psyllid out of our country. We failed. We do not want to fail again. So how did it get here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the word “Asian” is in the pest’s name, and China has a recent history of biological warfare programs gone wrong (that is, unless you are one of those conspiracy theorists who believes Covid &lt;em&gt;did not&lt;/em&gt; come from a lab), the internet commentariat, wherever this issue is raised, points to the CCP. The most popular position seems to be China destroyed Florida’s oranges on purpose. I don’t see much evidence to support this position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;did not&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citrus greening was first detected in China in the early 20th Century, just before it rapidly spread throughout Asia. It reached Africa by the 1940s, and the Middle East by the 1970s and 1980s. Finally, it hit Florida in notable force by the early 2000s, and with recent cases of the disease popping up in Spain we can assume Europe is next. With greening spread around the world over the course of a century the obvious culprit is trade, which means we can blame, if anything, globalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, weaponizing some other blight like the greening bacterium would be trivially easy, if difficult to contain, and we have some recent evidence, if not proof, that China is thinking about this class of danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a few months ago, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Yunqing Jian, a postdoctoral researcher in Michigan, and Zunyong Liu, based in China, with conspiring to smuggle Fusarium graminearum into the United States without permits. This is a fungus that causes head blight in wheat. Prosecutors alleged Liu carried fungal samples through Detroit Metropolitan Airport for use in a University of Michigan lab, while Jian helped coordinate the effort. Because the pathogen could potentially harm our staple crops, officials described it as a potential “agroterrorism weapon.” Jian was arrested in the U.S., while Liu remains abroad, and the case is still moving through federal court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Fusarium graminearum is common in the United States. While the Chinese students are undoubtedly embroiled in some sort of espionage operation — I am once again asking: why are these people here? — on closer study I think the CCP is probably trying to leverage US resources and knowledge to spin up a better defensive strategy at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the service of defending their food supply, China has a long history of stealing our shit. Some recent bangers in the genre: Mo Hailong stole corn secrets from Monsanto in 2016, for which we sent his ass to prison; Weiqiang Zhang stole genetically engineered rice seeds from Ventria Biosciences, and was convicted in 2017; and Haitao Xiang stole a proprietary crop-modeling algorithm in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My theory, other than, well, the Chinese just sort of steal everything, is — in diametric contrast with the United States — they’re uniquely worried about food, with a history so foreign to us the average American genuinely can’t understand their behavior. China has about 300 million acres of arable land, or something like 0.2 acres per person. This is less than half the global average, which is something like 0.47 acres per person, and about 17% of the American average, which is something like 1.16 acres per person.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In a world before cheap global trade, any time that country suffered a little dry spell, or a flood, or a violent political revolution, it was looking at mass starvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, over the last 150 years, there have been multiple major Chinese famines, each of which resulted in millions, or even tens of millions dead: the Northern Chinese Famine in 1876; the “Great” North China Famine in 1928; the Henan Famine in 1942; and most recently the Great Chinese Famine in 1959, which left between 15 and 55 million dead (numbers tend to deflate into the low double digit millions when you ask a communist). My dad was born in 1949. My mom was born in 1955. Most boomers were alive for this&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food scarcity, a fear of food scarcity, reaction to food scarcity is in a sense the entire Chinese history, including its very recent history. This means the Chinese people are not only motivated by food, with food scarcity a major and emotional political issue in the country, but especially keyed into what happens to a country without food. Much as US anxiety over nuclear weapons, which we created, led to mass proliferation, is it possible Chinese anxiety over mass starvation has led to military thinking in this vein? The concept isn’t even new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after World War II, the United States researched multiple forms of “anti-crop” biological weapons, not only including specific funguses (many of them more colloquially referred to as “rusts”) targeting various cereals, but bombs capable of delivering the blights, before spearheading and signing the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention. Japan, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union all have a history experimenting on anti-crop technology, with the former Soviet Union apparently leading the charge from the 1920s through the 1990s, employing tens of thousands of personnel and building the largest stockpile of biological weapons in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there is like a zero percent chance the CCP isn’t secretly working on this stuff, and if China invades Taiwan, I think there is a very good chance we suddenly come down with a bunch of weird wheat infections. It doesn’t matter if the CCP has been spying on our agricultural science for the last decade or so in order to better feed the Chinese people. It’s safe to assume the Chinese government is aware of every newly modified crop we’re working on, and every crop’s weakness. The threat of agricultural warfare — which is an existential risk — therefore exists, even if it isn’t present. This means, in addition to focusing on diseases we’re aware of, we need to be working on a system capable of responding rapidly to new invasive threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1971235194138186100"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is our modern political discourse:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1971235194138186100"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/417025ac-af96-4962-9e19-76acade9426b_1198x482.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical contribution from center left (is he though?) thinkboy Matt Yglesias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. First, I should note the major value of Florida’s orange industry is its industry, not the oranges. Mine is not only an argument in favor of the resources and jobs that industry brings to our country, but in the security domestic agriculture affords. Then, it’s important to note as well the incredible irony in decrying tariffs on imported produce following a blight we almost certainly acquired from imported citrus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while Matt’s was the most obnoxious response to my initial note on the subject, it shared something in common with reaction across the ideological spectrum. In quote tweets, from government conspiracies to blaming various politicians from various states, none of whom had anything to do with this, a great number of people seem incapable of facing any specific, new danger free of other random political bullshit. This is Internet Brain, which Americans can unfortunately not blame on globalism, as we invented it ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the citrus industry’s crisis in Florida has nothing to do with Trump’s tariffs or Biden’s open borders. I also doubt even the average extremist from either political pole would be uninterested in novel solutions to citrus greening. They just, I don’t know, can’t seem to focus on anything that doesn’t track to what they’re mad about on X today. But we have to look at this as a unique problem, and fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly, that probably looks like maintaining our presently robust mix of smaller family farms, which count for the overwhelming majority of farms in our country, and giant centralized farms, which account for the majority of production. Too much reliance on either poses greater risk, with smaller farms lacking the uniform decision-making required to defend entire regions from some immediate new danger along some given set of standards, and larger farms generally weaker to single blights due to the monoculture innate of scale. It feels like sort of a copout, but my gut read is we should probably avoid further decentralization &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;centralization of U.S. agriculture. We’re maybe in a kind of Goldilocks zone right now, and should do our best to stay put.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly, however, America needs the capability to immediately assess novel invasive threats, spin up solutions in gene drives, and deploy the solutions. Here, I think there’s a role for the federal government. And “BioForce” goes hard as hell. Trump? Come on, big guy, we all know you love a cute branding moment, and imagine all the nice things our grandchildren will say about the man who saved the world from mass starvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, we do have to think about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While American citrus still has miles to plummet before we reach the bottom, the next big crop failure might not be a sweet treat, and could constitute something more substantial. Then, the responsible party won’t really matter. We’ll still have to deal with the consequences, and in this we can look to China for some sense of the risk: millions of lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fact Check: Yes (Per His Own Words), Zohran Mamdani is a Socialist</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/fact-check-yes-per-his-own-words</link>
      <description>the new york times recently insisted nyc’s mayoral frontrunner wasn’t a socialist. a closer look at his own statements tells a different story.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is many things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s a man of taste, known for throwing extravagant &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/12/us-news/socialist-nyc-mayoral-contender-zohran-mamdani-secretly-tied-the-knot-in-exotic-dubai-ceremony-photos-show/"&gt;weddings&lt;/a&gt; from rooftops in Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/12/us-news/socialist-nyc-mayoral-contender-zohran-mamdani-secretly-tied-the-knot-in-exotic-dubai-ceremony-photos-show/"&gt;weddings&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s a humanitarian, who stands to enrich New Yorkers lives’ by &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/globalize-the-inmate-fada-how-zohran-could-let-thousands-of-prisoners-walk-free"&gt;unleashing&lt;/a&gt; thousands of violent felons into their neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/globalize-the-inmate-fada-how-zohran-could-let-thousands-of-prisoners-walk-free"&gt;unleashing&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’s an aspiring &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQVsVNPkPmE"&gt;rapper&lt;/a&gt;, who enjoys dropping bars under the alias “Mr. Cardamom” whilst wearing only a bib and staring dead-eyed into the camera from the interior of a halal cart as school-aged boys dance alongside him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQVsVNPkPmE"&gt;rapper&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one thing he is not — &lt;em&gt;don’t you dare even suggest it&lt;/em&gt; — is a socialist. Seriously. He’s not. Enough already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;don’t you dare even suggest it&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such was the insistence of the New York Times, which recently published an entire 1,200-word &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/30/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayor-democratic-socialism.html"&gt;thinkpiece&lt;/a&gt; “debunking” Mamdani’s socialist affiliations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/30/nyregion/zohran-mamdani-nyc-mayor-democratic-socialism.html"&gt;thinkpiece&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their article, the author begins by listing off instances of Cuomo and Trump describing Mamdani as a socialist and a “100 percent communist lunatic,” respectively (Trump has since started to &lt;a href="https://x.com/litnewsnet/status/1966524116812308573"&gt;refer&lt;/a&gt; to Mamdani as “My Little Communist”) (he really is the nickname king) before clarifying where the mayoral frontrunner &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; stands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/litnewsnet/status/1966524116812308573"&gt;refer&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[Mamdani] is a &lt;em&gt;democratic&lt;/em&gt; socialist, which means his beliefs are similar to those of socialists but not exactly the same,” our author helpfully explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;democratic&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per their own definition, socialism is “a doctrine that calls for public control of property and natural resources,” which “stands in direct opposition to capitalism, a system in which private individuals own the means of production.” But &lt;em&gt;democratic&lt;/em&gt; socialism, the Times clarifies, is less about wielding the power of the state to take over private companies, and more about “wielding resources to help the greatest number of people… through a democratic process.” See, democratic socialists don’t &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; your business to hand over its assets to the state at gunpoint — the people&lt;em&gt; vote&lt;/em&gt; for your business to hand over its assets to the state. Isn’t that sweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;democratic&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt; vote&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Mamdani, they tell us, in their best impression of his own personal comms team, “has proposed nothing remotely close to a socialist-like takeover of private companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool. There’s just one problem. Mamdani has quite literally been referring to himself as a socialist for years — and without the “democratic” qualifier, which the Times cartoonishly insists means something that must come as a great shock to all of the people who actually embrace the political label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at some of the key instances where Mr. Cardamom described himself as the very thing our esteemed paper of record just took 1,200 words to tell you he’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone were most certainly not a socialist, one thing that would be super weird for that person to say is “there was definitely a point at which I started to call myself a socialist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a statement would seem to put to rest any doubts that said person was, in fact, a socialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, what’s this? Mamdani uttering those very words in a Jacobin &lt;a href="https://jacobin.com/2021/02/zohran-mamdani-new-york-state-assembly-queens#:~:text=fact%2C%20of%20inspiration.-,There%20was%20definitely%20a%20point%20at%20which%20I%20started%20to,Hadas%20Thier"&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; four years ago?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://jacobin.com/2021/02/zohran-mamdani-new-york-state-assembly-queens#:~:text=fact%2C%20of%20inspiration.-,There%20was%20definitely%20a%20point%20at%20which%20I%20started%20to,Hadas%20Thier"&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think that my politics have changed all that much in my life. I can look back and identify the same core values that I have now that I had growing up. But there was definitely a point at which I started to call myself a socialist, and that was Bernie’s 2016 campaign. Because I saw all of these beliefs and these values that I held so dear, espoused by a man who proudly called himself a socialist as a result of those beliefs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think that my politics have changed all that much in my life. I can look back and identify the same core values that I have now that I had growing up. But there was definitely a point at which I started to call myself a socialist, and that was Bernie’s 2016 campaign. Because I saw all of these beliefs and these values that I held so dear, espoused by a man who proudly called himself a socialist as a result of those beliefs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm. If my knowledge of the English language is correct, it sure seems like this totally-not-socialist guy just called himself a socialist. Specifically, right around the part where he said he “definitely” referred to himself as a “socialist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe it was just a one-off moment. A slip of the tongue, after a long night of halal-cart rapping. Happens to the best of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet — &lt;em&gt;what’s this? &lt;/em&gt;Mamdani once again embracing the term, this time in a Breakfast Club &lt;a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/zohran-mamdani-mayor-new-york-city-socialist"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;four months ago?? &lt;/em&gt;After being asked by host Charlamagne Tha God about why some politicians shy away from the socialist label, Mamdani replies bluntly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;what’s this? &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/zohran-mamdani-mayor-new-york-city-socialist"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;four months ago?? &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t hide this. You know, it’s how I see the world. It’s the world that I want… It’s funny, there’s this one guy who comments under almost every one of my tweets and he’s like, ‘he’s a socialist!’ I’m like, ‘yeah, it’s in my bio.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t hide this. You know, it’s how I see the world. It’s the world that I want… It’s funny, there’s this one guy who comments under almost every one of my tweets and he’s like, ‘he’s a socialist!’ I’m like, ‘yeah, it’s in my bio.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm. Weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While readers should note Mamdani’s bio currently reads “Democratic Socialist,” the fact that he responds to the accusation he’s a socialist with “yeah” certainly sounds like an, um, admission!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s take a look at one more for good measure. Surely a non-socialist wouldn’t outright embrace the term &lt;em&gt;three separate times&lt;/em&gt;… right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;three separate times&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet… what’s this?? Our boy Mr. Cardamom posting a Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1156471036291713&amp;amp;set=a.357224419549716"&gt;meme&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;last month&lt;/em&gt; straight up accepting the socialist label in a post about free buses?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1156471036291713&amp;amp;set=a.357224419549716"&gt;meme&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;last month&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ay dios mio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If making buses free means I’m a socialist, well…” Mamdani captions the post in question, alongside the following image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fd9d8fab-6cd9-45ea-9acf-ff086c029dfe_1440x1920.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not really worried,” Mamdani says in the picture with a wry smile. Translation? Call me a socialist all you want, IDGAF. Hell, I just told my boy Charlamagne I was a socialist on his huge radio show. YOLO, no rules, storm the gates, from the river to the sea, buses shall be free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while Mamdani may not be worried about being called a socialist… the New York Times sure seemed concerned when they felt the need to ‘clarify’ the mayoral candidate’s political affiliations with this recent piece. Even when said clarification ran counter to *checks notes* Mamdani’s own words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, dear readers, is the real cause for concern here. Not whatever the hell Zohran does or doesn’t choose to call himself (I’m frankly more worried about the aforementioned Rikers prisoners being released, particularly at a time when freshly released felons are stabbing women on trains), but the fact that one of America’s largest newspapers apparently felt compelled to cover for Zohran — as if they were a bib in one of his music videos — right in the middle of a high-stakes election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Mamdani can call himself a “socialist.” He can also call himself a “democratic socialist,” or “Mr. Cardamom,” or “MC Marxism the Liberator.” That’s his prerogative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the media decides it’s their job to protect a mayoral candidate? &lt;em&gt;From his own plain admissions?&lt;/em&gt; It starts to look less like news reporting, and more like PR with a byline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;From his own plain admissions?&lt;/em&gt;

      <title>The Life and Death of American Malls</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-life-and-death-of-american-malls</link>
      <description>rip malls and the socialist who escaped nazis to create them, and the era when we had one perfectly air-conditioned place to hang out together irl</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Saturdays in high school, if I wasn’t getting wasted on Coors Light in a friend’s basement, I was at the mall. It was the largest in my state (Pennsylvania) and the third-largest in the nation: 2.7 million square feet of retail, two food courts, seven department stores, 40-plus restaurants, a brewery, majestically arcing skylights, and a 30-foot-tall fountain lined with marble. It was always 70 degrees, the tiled floor was always immaculate, and it was never empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t remember buying much — buying stuff wasn’t the point. The point of being at the mall was: to wear a hoodie, feel vaguely rich and aristocratic (marble floors, gushing fountains), and to smell the horny perfume they piped into Hollister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One man designed basically every mall in America. He was born in Vienna and fled to New York with “eight dollars and no English,” in his words, after the Nazis invaded. He had a degree in architecture and a background designing theatrical stage sets, and he was contracted by the department store Dayton’s (which would become Target) to build a shopping district around its next location near Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Victor Gruen designed a city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early plans for that first mall featured homes, schools, hospitals, a manmade lake, a supermarket, a bakery, and a florist. Gruen, a lifelong socialist, thought malls could cure American suburbs of what he perceived to be wrong with them: everyone was lonely all the time. He wrapped his malls in windowless walls because (a) he wanted us to forget our cars, (b) he thought outdoor malls were ugly, and (c) inside the enclosed space, he could manipulate every detail — lighting, temperature, entrances and exits — to move people toward its center, which he dubbed “The Garden Court of Perpetual Spring.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Broadcast TV Is Obsolete. Let's Auction the Public Airwaves.</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/broadcast-tv-is-obsolete-lets-auction</link>
      <description>kimmel's brief cancellation revealed a deeper problem: the 80-plus-year-old design of public broadcast tv is outdated. free the airwaves and put them to use for the future.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Jimmy Kimmel was canceled. Although only briefly “censored” by Disney (or allegedly by the President himself?), the late night host was taken off the air over factually incorrect, incendiary comments regarding Charlie Kirk’s assassination. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr was accused of “jawboning” Disney into cancelling Kimmel after his remarks on the Benny Johnson podcast, and since then, he’s been scrutinized by both left-wing defenders of the comedian and right-wing small government advocates alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimmel was only canceled for six days. The real story here is less about free speech than the complexity of America’s communications law, and the bureaucracy surrounding our 80-plus-year-old public national broadcast networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government controls access to our broadcast TV airwaves. Since 1941, the FCC has licensed some of those airwaves to traditional broadcast networks. Unlike cable and streaming platforms, these networks are subject to federal law mandating they air content in the “public interest,” in addition to the corporate decisions of their parent companies — Disney for ABC, Paramount for CBS, and Comcast for NBC. (This “public interest” mandate was behind Carr’s comments.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But public television is extremely outdated. Most Americans use social media, streaming platforms, and the internet to get their news now. It’s been 84 years since we launched government-controlled TV stations; technology has accelerated, and the world is different. We need something new.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Founders: Beware the Kamikaze Round</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/founders-beware-the-kamikaze-round</link>
      <description>massive early funding rounds inflate startup valuations and outpace the market, usually ending in disaster. there's no law against leaving money on the table.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It’s 1938.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fujio Hayashi, a 22-year-old pilot in the Imperial Japanese Air Force, has volunteered for a mission of certain death: strap into a fighter plane loaded with 500 kilograms of explosives, fly to mainland China, and dive-bomb into the first enemy position he sees. Japan is experimenting with a new weapon of war: the Kamikaze, a suicidally effective means of knocking out enemy ships and bases used to terrifying effect in the Pacific theater of World War II. Hayashi is the very first Kamikaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sort of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He dutifully takes to the air, identifies a military installation, crashes into it — and survives. The bomb doesn’t go off, a technical malfunction common in beta-testing. He unstraps, gets back to base, survives the war, and lives until 93. His grandkids said he loved classical music and stray cats.¹&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A warning for founders: You are probably not Hayashi.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>ChatGPT Doesn't Cause Brain Damage. Academia Does.</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/chatgpt-doesnt-cause-brain-damage</link>
      <description>an mit study allegedly claimed using chatgpt damages your brain. it was uncritically accepted by almost everyone but only proved american universities are broken.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This piece was first published on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://drdevonprice.substack.com/p/there-is-no-evidence-that-ai-causes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devon’s substack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This piece was first published on &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://drdevonprice.substack.com/p/there-is-no-evidence-that-ai-causes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devon’s substack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Devon’s substack&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, an &lt;em&gt;unreviewed draft &lt;/em&gt;of a scientific article began making the rounds, examining the relationship between LLM use and brain functionality — and since then, many reporters have incorrectly claimed it proves that using ChatGPT damages people’s brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;unreviewed draft &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an educator and writer, I worry about programs like ChatGPT, Claude, and Google’s Gemini, which when used carelessly strip the struggle and reward out of writing. But as a psychologist and lifelong skeptic, I’m also dismayed by sloppy, sensationalistic science reporting, not to mention how eager the public is to believe any claim that sounds scary or comes paired with a grainy image of a brain scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0d707832-1cac-40a8-a6e3-6f579e00f591_1422x621.webp"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I wanted to take a moment today to unpack exactly what the study authors did, what they actually&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found, and what the results of their work might mean for anyone concerned about the rise of AI — or the ongoing problem of irresponsible science reporting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;The Major Caveats&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper has not been peer-reviewed, which is generally seen as an essential part of ensuring research quality in academia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers chose to get this paper into the public eye as quickly as possible because they are concerned about the use of LLMs, so their biases and professional motivations ought to be taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its subject pool is incredibly small (N=54 total).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjects had no reason to care about the quality of the essays they wrote, so it’s hardly surprising the ones who were allowed to use AI tools didn’t try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;EEG scans only monitored brain function &lt;em&gt;while &lt;/em&gt;writing the essays, not subjects’ overall cognitive abilities or effort completing tasks they actually cared about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google users were &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;found to utilize fewer cognitive resources and engage in less memory retrieval while writing their essays, but nobody seems to hand-wring about people using search engines to augment writing anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive ability and motivation were not measured in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in cognitive ability and motivation over time were not measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a laboratory study that cannot tell us how individuals actually use LLMs in their daily life, what the long-term effects of LLM use are, and if there are any differences in those who choose to use LLMs frequently versus those who do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers themselves used an AI model to analyze their data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain-imaging research is seductive and authoritative-seeming to the public, making it more likely to get picked up (and misrepresented) by reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Educators have multiple reasons to feel professionally and emotionally threatened by widespread LLM use, which influences the studies we design and the conclusions we draw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students have very little reason to care about writing well right now, given the state of higher ed; if we want that to change, we have to reward slow, painstaking effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stories we tell about our abilities matter.

&lt;p&gt;Head author Nataliya Kosmyna and her colleagues at the MIT Media Lab set out to study how the use of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT affects students’ critical engagement with writing tasks, using electroencephalogram scans to monitor their brains’ electrical activity while writing. They also evaluated the quality of participants’ papers on several dimensions, and questioned them after the fact about what they remembered of their essays.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Men's Health: The Benefits of Bleeding</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/mens-health-the-benefits-of-bleeding</link>
      <description>from leeches to bloodletting, the ancients were right: modern doctors are overlooking the risk of iron overload in men, who evolved to bleed in combat (start donating, boys)</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 1824, a French sergeant was stabbed through the chest in a duel. Within minutes of his arrival at the hospital, doctors drained 20 ounces of his blood. Through the night, another 24 ounces. The next morning, 10 ounces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the following 14 hours, he was bled five more times — losing nearly two liters total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He survived. Physicians believed the blood loss was therapeutic. They thought it saved his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s an extreme example, but regardless, bloodletting is lindy. It’s persisted across 60 distinct cultures for over 3,000 years, emerging independently multiple times throughout human history. Medieval European barber-surgeons displayed bloodstained bandages wrapped around poles outside their shops — the origin of today’s red-and-white barber pole. Patients would grip wooden rods until their veins bulged while surgeons collected their blood in pewter basins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary biology explains some of it. Men evolved, essentially, for combat. Roughly 58 percent of paleoamerican males show evidence of violent trauma compared to 18 percent of females. Hunter-gatherer males adapted to regular blood loss from hunting injuries and interpersonal violence, but modernity eliminated most of these armed conflicts, leaving men with an evolutionary mismatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aware of this, medieval doctors prescribed periodic bloodletting for men. It was all part of their theory of humors, which turned out to be wrong, though the observation that men might benefit from periodic blood loss is rooted in solid science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>The Problem Isn't AI Therapy. It's That Most Therapy Is Trash.</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-problem-isnt-ai-therapy-its-that</link>
      <description>you're as likely to be deluded by a sycophantic human therapist as you are by chatgpt</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“ChatGPT as your therapist?” asks Scientific American. “Here’s why that’s so risky.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. Vaile Wright, a licensed psychologist and senior director of the American Psychological Association’s Office of Health Care Innovation, told Scientific American last month that the psychological profession’s greatest concern about AI therapists is that “they’re actually being coded in a way to keep you on the platform for as long as possible because that’s the business model. And the way that they do that is by being unconditionally validating and reinforcing, almost to the point of sycophancy.” &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The state of Illinois recently went so far as to ban AI therapy altogether, with the secretary of the Illinois Department of Financial &amp;amp; Professional Regulation declaring in August, “The people of Illinois deserve quality healthcare from real, qualified professionals and not computer programs that pull information from all corners of the internet to generate responses that harm patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These contentions are interesting, but misleading. First, the term “AI therapist” can refer to anything from a person having a back-and-forth therapeutic conversation with, say, ChatGPT or Grok, to someone using a specially programmed mental health chatbot like &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/22/slingshot-new-investors-generative-ai-mental-health-therapy-chatbot-called-ash/"&gt;Sonia&lt;/a&gt;, backed by Y Combinator, or &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/22/slingshot-new-investors-generative-ai-mental-health-therapy-chatbot-called-ash/"&gt;Slingshot AI&lt;/a&gt;, backed by a16z. The former, totally unregulated and self-guided, is far more likely to affirm the user than the latter, which is specifically programmed to be a therapist — but Illinois’ ban affects both, making it counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/22/slingshot-new-investors-generative-ai-mental-health-therapy-chatbot-called-ash/"&gt;Sonia&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/22/slingshot-new-investors-generative-ai-mental-health-therapy-chatbot-called-ash/"&gt;Slingshot AI&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s a deeper category error that opponents of AI therapists are making: namely, they are assuming contemporary therapy is healthy or good to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>I'm Sorry But You Have to Assimilate</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/im-sorry-but-you-have-to-assimilate</link>
      <description>if you want to live here, you have to integrate. it's the least you can do.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Next year, America turns 250. But are we ready to celebrate her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t always seem so. Minneapolis mayoral hopeful Omar Fateh calls Somalia “our home.” Illinois Rep. Delia Ramirez tells a cheering crowd, “I am a proud Guatemalan before I am American.” Both were born here. I wasn’t. Yet I can’t shake the feeling that I love this country more than they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved to America nearly a decade ago. I’ve worked in conservative media — first at Tucker Carlson’s &lt;em&gt;Daily Caller&lt;/em&gt;, then at Fox. Most of my friends are conservatives from the South and Midwest who moved to D.C. or New York for work. I know how they see immigration: legal is good, illegal is bad. I also know how many city liberals see it: fine, as long as immigrants don’t show up in front of their family home in Greenwich, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Daily Caller&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my spare time, I host events for legal, skilled immigrants — people building companies, filing patents, contributing to America’s economy. Most of them didn’t come here chasing abstract American “liberty,” and they don’t spend much time thinking about our founding ideals. They came for opportunity. They came to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to sell them on America, not just as a visa-granting machine or a place to quickly cash out, but as a nation — one with a history, culture, and set of values — and that’s not easy. Too often, they think I’m selling them “whiteness.” Why? Because we’ve convinced ourselves expecting people to assimilate is bigoted and racist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, we’ve swung hard in the opposite direction — tolerating enclaves that barely assimilate at all, cities dominated by foreign flags, foreign languages, foreign cultures (Dearborn Heights, MI is a good example). In June, illegal immigrants and American-born citizens waved Mexican flags defiantly over burning cars in major American neighborhoods. At the same time, corporate America and our media class eagerly celebrate every heritage month, but treat Memorial Day like an awkward obligation and the Fourth of July as little more than a long weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t some right-wing reflex, either. Obama admitted feeling the same way in &lt;em&gt;The Audacity of Hope&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Audacity of Hope&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I’m honest with myself, I must admit that I’m not entirely immune to such nativist sentiments. When I see Mexican flags waved at pro-immigration demonstrations, I sometimes feel a flush of patriotic resentment. When I’m forced to use a translator to communicate with the guy fixing my car, I feel a certain frustration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before coming to America, I’d lived in India and the UK. In India, I couldn’t get past the weight of collectivism. In the UK, I couldn’t get past the skepticism. And for me, vibe matters. If I’m surrounded by collectivists or skeptics, I can’t breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America was different. Here I found irrational optimists. Whacky dudes who obsess over ideas. And when I found that? My gratitude was overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I share no blood with the Scots-Irish settlers who came to Appalachia, nor the Irish, Italian, and other earlier waves of immigrants, including the WASP settlers who came before them. But I find myself drawn to their stories. They often arrived fleeing persecution or political upheaval. They didn’t come here for handouts. Many of them had nowhere else to go. They were forced to plant roots, to build this country, and, eventually, to assimilate, meaning: to give up a part of their identity in order to become American. Which they did, willingly, even after facing resistance, because they believed in the American project and knew assimilation was the price of entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s picture is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Murder is Bad</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/murder-is-bad</link>
      <description>pirate wires #148 // on accusations of "fanning the flames" after accurately describing reality, and an earnest appeal to the center left: we must reassert a strong taboo against violence — together</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A good old-fashioned letter to the editor. &lt;/strong&gt;It’s been a stressful, emotional week for the country, and I want to be more helpful. In fact, while admittedly difficult, I’ve reflected a bit on the matter and &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; I can be more helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A good old-fashioned letter to the editor. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably, the easiest first thing I can do is just be very clear about what I’m trying to accomplish with my writing at the moment: I want a strong cultural taboo against the celebration of political violence, as I believe this will help prevent an escalation of political violence in our country, and I want the center left’s help in reasserting this taboo, because without the center left on board I do not think success is possible. My hope is writers on the center left will receive this piece in the spirit with which it’s intended, and join me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, after a bit of pushback this weekend, both publicly and privately, it became obvious to me that I am presently not even close to persuading you people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and most eloquent bit of pushback I received was shared via DM:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey man - just want to say when things like “the whole left celebrated” are communicated, it honestly makes myself and friends feel like we are being threatened with retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are thinking about buying guns as people are claiming they need to get back at us. I’m mostly a centrist tbh but I lean left, so of course I’d be bucketed into this group by some nutcase who wants blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I really hope leaders like yourself can help keep people thinking rationally. Especially in hard times. We are the powder keg and the sparks are too often flying in ways that don’t even make sense. The perfect cocktail our adversaries wish more and are eager to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really respect you. People across the board want safety and security. I’m sorry he was killed. No one I know celebrated it. It’s just really bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really respect you. People across the board want safety and security. I’m sorry he was killed. No one I know celebrated it. It’s just really bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in an email from a reader:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, Mr. Solana. A few days ago I read your piece in the Atlantic and I was taken by your writing, your humor, your apparent pragmatism, and even handedness. So I signed up for this newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are really dangerous times, at least that's how I feel. And having just discovered you I was kind of hoping, while I didn't know what I was hoping I was just interested in reading this newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have to say your bit will only fan the flames, inciting people who are looking to thinkers like you for a sense of how to deal with what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say your bit will only fan the flames, inciting people who are looking to thinkers like you for a sense of how to deal with what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, while the great majority of comments in &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/we-have-to-look-the-reactions-to"&gt;my last piece&lt;/a&gt; were supportive (this is my house after all), I received more pushback than usual. Of note, a trans acquaintance of mine expressed fear, and — again — “disappointment” in my somehow contributing to this fear by cataloguing the celebrations of Charlie’s murder. This was even before we knew the killer was dating a man in the middle of some kind of gender transition, which has only further heightened America’s conversation on “trans violence.” Fear is, I think, the theme of the day. I agree there is reason to be afraid, though I respectfully and forcefully disagree that my writing has anything to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/we-have-to-look-the-reactions-to"&gt;my last piece&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m worried about escalating violence myself, which I’ve warned about for years. While I’ve been very clear on the issue, I will once again repeat: I do not believe the average Democrat is violent, or wants more violence. The truth is obviously the opposite. I believe there are a minority of people who want violence, and who celebrate violence. But where it seems I differ with many on the center left is I believe this is a large (or, too large) and worrying minority. I also believe celebration of political violence is acutely a problem among younger people on the political left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, even this morning, in friendly conversation with a couple acquaintances of mine on the center left, there was a strong aversion not only to admitting this problem exists, but to admitting celebration over Charlie’s assassination was widespread. I do not understand this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I shared &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/we-have-to-look-the-reactions-to"&gt;the first batch&lt;/a&gt; of anecdotes last week, gathered before even a full day had passed after Charlie’s assassination, I stressed these were not just bots. These were teachers, nurses, government officials celebrating a political assassination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/we-have-to-look-the-reactions-to"&gt;the first batch&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I shared these examples, there have been countless more. They span class, race, and geography: an out of work loser ass &lt;a href="https://x.com/ericldaugh/status/1966933647925166468?s=43"&gt;actress&lt;/a&gt; calling for the murder of Charlie’s family; a &lt;a href="https://x.com/jamesokeefeiii/status/1966649724544368937?s=43"&gt;FEMA employee&lt;/a&gt; caught admitting his colleagues all laughed about the news of Charlie’s death, and saying he deserved it; a small town &lt;a href="https://x.com/TimOnPoint/status/1967229925498482722"&gt;school board member&lt;/a&gt; posting “I remember when we used to be okay shooting Nazis”; a &lt;a href="https://x.com/niznellie3/status/1966450417358749861?s=43"&gt;University of Michigan professor&lt;/a&gt; writing “violence is a solution.” In the realm of tacit justifications, rather than outright celebrations, there are endless new examples, from &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/justplainzack/reel/DOj6wsqkvRj/"&gt;Real Housewives&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://x.com/JasonJournoDC/status/1967358172206940389"&gt;Don Lemon&lt;/a&gt; (spiritually the same I guess), hounding random people in the streets, all but begging them to express some hatred of Charlie (the woman Don Lemon interviewed in the clip I linked did a wonderful job of maintaining her humanity, fwiw).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conversation with more principled center leftists willing to engage here, I’ve been told the reaction is of course heinous, but not statistically relevant. Even 30,000 or 40,000 posts in the context of our total population, they argue, is a small fraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple days after the assassination, Jonathan Chait &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/09/charlie-kirk-democrats-social-media/684194/"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; something similar. He pointed out that prominent Democratic politicians were not celebrating Charlie’s murder, and in the absence of such derangement right wingers had invented a controversy — this horrifying reaction presently under discussion. To prove his position, he highlighted a condemnation of Zohran Mamdani’s, who nobody, as far as I can tell, had accused of celebrating Charlie’s murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/09/charlie-kirk-democrats-social-media/684194/"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan then went on to characterize the heinous, widespread response the rest of us are actually talking about as “scattered,” and tried to argue this was all a matter of scale. The country is very big. Of course there are some bad comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is outrageous obfuscation. First, we all know the average American is consuming content far more than he is creating content. These are many thousands of examples &lt;em&gt;among people who post&lt;/em&gt;. Then, reaction to the posts in terms of shares and likes is at least an order of magnitude greater. Come on, we understand how social media works. Why obscure this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;among people who post&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The politics of the killer, which so many among both left and right-wing talking heads have lost themselves in discussing, is not even that relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Professor Geoffrey Miller &lt;a href="https://x.com/primalpoly/status/1967653062161686629"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on X, “Charlie Kirk’s assassination revealed a small network of radical Antifa Leftists who wanted one conservative dead. The public reaction to his assassination revealed that millions of ‘mainstream’ Leftists want all conservatives dead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/primalpoly/status/1967653062161686629"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what we are discussing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for a science enjoyer like Jonathan, we don’t even need to look at the anecdotal evidence that sentiment in favor of violence is real. We don’t need to talk about the scale of the commentary, or reaction to that commentary. We can just look at available data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polling, both before and after Charlie’s assassination, indicates an alarmingly high acceptance of political violence, especially among young Democrats. I touched on this a few days before Charlie was murdered in &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/we-have-to-look-the-reactions-to"&gt;Abundant Delusion&lt;/a&gt;, a piece of my own:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polling before the 2024 election indicated &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/1-in-5-americans-think-violence-may-solve-u-s-divisions-poll-finds"&gt;a growing trend&lt;/a&gt; of Americans expressing support for political violence, with the right wing in the lead. But after Donald Trump’s reelection, and two attempted assassinations, a stunning &lt;a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/progressives-political-violence-donald-trump-assassination-attempt"&gt;survey from &lt;em&gt;City Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that “38 percent of respondents, and 55 percent of those left of center, said assassinating President Trump would be at least somewhat justified; 31 percent of respondents, and 48 percent of those left of center, said the same about” Elon Musk. Another &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/how-political-violence-ends/683432/"&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt; shows that even more Americans — including one in three attendees at a handful of anti-Trump protests — believe we “may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/how-political-violence-ends/683432/"&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directly following Charlie’s murder, YouGov released &lt;a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/52960-charlie-kirk-americans-political-violence-poll"&gt;a new poll&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, most Americans believe political violence is a problem, which is very good news. However, 16% of liberals thought a “feeling of joy” about the death of their political opponents was usually or always acceptable. Only 4% of conservatives, and 7% of moderates agreed. Worse, among the “very liberal,” 25% believed political violence &lt;em&gt;could sometimes be justified&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/52960-charlie-kirk-americans-political-violence-poll"&gt;a new poll&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;could sometimes be justified&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can understand some initial partisan impulse to downplay political violence directly following a political murder, and in most cases I doubt this is done with truly malevolent intent. Polling seems to indicate both sides have a problem with this, for what it’s worth, as the numbers tend to dance around a little depending on who was just murdered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in terms of the more narrow and grisly question of whether political violence is “ever justified,” YouGov found younger and more liberal people were (while still a minority) &lt;a href="https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/Protests__Extremism__and_Violence_poll_results.pdf#page=21"&gt;more likely to say yes&lt;/a&gt; — in an earlier poll, immediately following the assassination of Democratic politician Melissa Hortman and her husband. In other words, this is not some situational noise. Most available evidence indicates this is a real trend on the young left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/Protests__Extremism__and_Violence_poll_results.pdf#page=21"&gt;more likely to say yes&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is curious, to first be told there are no widespread celebrations of violence, and then, after sharing examples and polling data, to be accused of targeting the people responsible, of “fanning the flames,” or of, essentially, joining the craziest wing of the left in wokeness. But here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, Thomas Chatterton Williams &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/09/christopher-rufo-doreen-st-felix/684189/"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, and decried, the right wing’s embrace of “cancel culture” in the Atlantic. The piece said nothing about Charlie, and mostly argued honestly about a trend on the right the likes of which Chris Rufo would probably not even deny were it not obviously published this weekend in response to the broad “cancellation” of assassination celebrants. Thomas &lt;a href="https://x.com/thomaschattwill/status/1966972124624544216"&gt;denied this&lt;/a&gt;, and later that weekend seemed to &lt;a href="https://x.com/thomaschattwill/status/1967150267633401893"&gt;agree&lt;/a&gt; that celebrating an assassination was an ethical breach worthy of firing (great). But he seems to have forgotten he himself admitted his initial feelings in an exchange with Mollie Hemingway on X:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/09/christopher-rufo-doreen-st-felix/684189/"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a href="https://x.com/thomaschattwill/status/1967150267633401893"&gt;agree&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="A screenshot of a social media post

&lt;p&gt;My hope is Thomas agrees with the version of Thomas that agrees with me — “cancellations” are mostly bad, “cancellations” in the case of public school teachers actually celebrating an assassination are not only good but essential to maintaining our democracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If maintaining a strong taboo against the celebration of political violence is “cancel culture,” okay, I don’t care, call me a cancel culture guy. Because if we fail to course correct here, this troubling lust for violence we’re observing on the young left will be mirrored throughout our culture. To prevent that mirroring, we need strong institutional guardrails policing the sentiment. Unfortunately, provided outlets like the New York Times are at least still aspirationally centrist, we have received something like the opposite of that to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the weekend, the New York Times not only softball interviewed Hasan Piker, an influencer who has argued for about a year that the assassin Luigi Mangione should be freed, healthcare insurance executives are complicit in mass murder, and that killing Brian Thompson — wrong, he is always quick to caveat, murder is wrong! — was an act of self-defense. They also published an op-ed of Hasan’s, either written or heavily neutered by a Times editor, on the subject of political violence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, kind of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/946fbbbd-b1a0-42b4-9298-45d470274d6f_859x419.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Hasan, or whoever wrote this piece for Hasan, did make sure to formally condemn the violence, the piece itself was a totally surreal sort of one-sided conversation with Charlie, who he was meant to formally debate before, again, &lt;em&gt;Charlie was murdered&lt;/em&gt;. Here, Hasan explains, is what Hasan would have told this man, who can no longer respond, were he able to respond, about all of his bad opinions, such as his bad opinions about guns and Gaza, which themselves are very violent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Charlie was murdered&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;What?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On what planet is this helpful? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasan is entitled, legally speaking, to be an evil person. But for the New York Times to frame the man as in some way legitimate, normal, reasonable? To actually ask someone who has contributed so prolifically to our budding leftist assassination culture what he thinks about this most recent political assassination? Is difficult to comprehend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a great deal of the despicable commentary we’ve seen in recent days, there is absolutely a case for “cancellation,” and in this the left should not denounce the right. It should join the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgive me for pointing across the Atlantic, but this is an especially helpful example: The Oxford Union president-elect George Abaraonye posted messages celebrating Charlie Kirk’s assassination, including “Charlie Kirk got shot, let’s f***ing go” in a WhatsApp group, and “Charlie Kirk got shot loool” on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the figurehead of an organization that exists to debate ideas. Abaraonye has himself debated Charlie. A gruesome detail, in that I personally can’t imagine shaking hands with someone, becoming acquainted and chatting casually with them in the context of our political differences, and then celebrating their murder. But whatever, we know he’s a piece of shit. The question is should this piece of shit lose his job? I think yes, certainly. I think obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Sullivan &lt;a href="https://substack.com/@sullydish/note/c-155604758"&gt;summed it up&lt;/a&gt; well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://substack.com/@sullydish/note/c-155604758"&gt;summed it up&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the president of a debating society to cheer the murder of someone for debating is quite simply disqualifying - as well as morally grotesque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president of the Oxford Union must resign immediately or the institution will be permanently and mortally wounded. If necessary, the Chancellor, a former Union president, should make that clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a former president and secretary of the Union, I’m ashamed and appalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resign. Now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resign. Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I will happily take it a step further than Andrew. If lil Georgie won’t resign, he must obviously be fired from his position, as his views make the performance of his position impossible. I feel similarly about people working for our government, healthcare workers, and teachers. These are people we have entrusted with the public’s protection and care. A violation of that trust totally undermines the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an expectation that I won’t be treated differently in a hospital if I’m a Republican, which is why a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/15/us-news/nj-surgeon-who-cheered-charlie-kirks-murder-resigns-as-suspended-nurse-who-called-him-out-is-reinstated/?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nypost&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;New Jersey surgeon&lt;/a&gt; coming out in favor of Charlie’s assassination, in front of a patient, can’t happen. Similarly, there is an expectation among mothers that their sons who liked Charlie are not being educated by a woman who would literally be happy if they died, which is why this surreal string of teachers across the country expressing bloodlust over Charlie’s murder has been so controversial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/09/15/us-news/nj-surgeon-who-cheered-charlie-kirks-murder-resigns-as-suspended-nurse-who-called-him-out-is-reinstated/?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nypost&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;New Jersey surgeon&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“America &lt;a href="https://x.com/NancyMace/status/1966197110837219715"&gt;became greater&lt;/a&gt; today,” wrote a teacher in South Carolina following Charlie’s assassination. “Yes, &lt;a href="https://x.com/libsoftiktok/status/1967317079339770313"&gt;I’m happy&lt;/a&gt; such evilness is gone from this world,” wrote a teacher in Michigan. In a lengthy post discussing the killing, a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-teacher-suspended-celebrating-charlie-kirks-assassination-good-riddance-bad-garbage"&gt;teacher in New York&lt;/a&gt; characterized Charlie as a modern Goebbels who was “interrupted by a bullet to the neck,” concluded “Good riddance to bad garbage,” and shared a picture of himself in a shirt that read “IS HE DEAD YET?” In at least three Massachusetts school districts teachers are&lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/09/15/mass-district-suspends-2nd-educator-over-charlie-kirk-comments/"&gt; under review&lt;/a&gt; for such sentiments, including one Framingham teacher who&lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/09/11/2-mass-teachers-reportedly-on-leave-for-reactions-to-charlie-kirks-death/"&gt; shared a video&lt;/a&gt; of herself twirling happily and singing “God Bless America” as news of Charlie Kirk’s death scrolled behind her, focusing the camera on the word “death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/NancyMace/status/1966197110837219715"&gt;became greater&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/libsoftiktok/status/1967317079339770313"&gt;I’m happy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-teacher-suspended-celebrating-charlie-kirks-assassination-good-riddance-bad-garbage"&gt;teacher in New York&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/09/15/mass-district-suspends-2nd-educator-over-charlie-kirk-comments/"&gt; under review&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/09/11/2-mass-teachers-reportedly-on-leave-for-reactions-to-charlie-kirks-death/"&gt; shared a video&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these people should be fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we’re also looking at a lot of overreaction at the moment. A teacher in Miamisburg, Ohio, was caught in a recording, which she did not share publicly herself, explaining to a student that Charlie was a “terrible person,” but violence is never justified. To my ear, it’s not even clear she thinks Charlie is “terrible” herself, or if she is only answering the question from a student who felt this way. The center left is furious over this attempted cancellation. In one typical post, Jesse Singal &lt;a href="https://x.com/jessesingal/status/1967377491548627343"&gt;expressed dismay&lt;/a&gt; over the overreach. I agree with him. I agree with all of you. This is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/jessesingal/status/1967377491548627343"&gt;expressed dismay&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I see a lot of people on the right focused on the most egregious examples of celebration, while folks on the left are almost exclusively focused on examples of overreach, distortion, mistakes in “cancellation.” Probably we can all do better here. Probably what we all need to be doing right now, or at least all of us creating media, is focusing on some bit of both in service of firmly establishing the bounds of this taboo in such a way as we don’t have to argue over this anymore. But also, more importantly, so we might express some shared sense of humanity with each other. We need to find common ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bar for firing a teacher is not “I disagree with Charlie’s beliefs.” The bar for firing a teacher is “Charlie’s death is good,” or “deserved,” or some version of “I am glad this happened.” Or sparks “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/us-news/ex-wapo-reporter-taylor-lorenz-says-she-felt-joy-over-assassination-of-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-feels-like-justice/"&gt;joy&lt;/a&gt;,” as Taylor Lorenz said of the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/10/us-news/ex-wapo-reporter-taylor-lorenz-says-she-felt-joy-over-assassination-of-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-feels-like-justice/"&gt;joy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to our media. Without some very clear and public apology, with a description of how she once approached the topic incorrectly, and how she intends to now move forward, Taylor Lorenz should never write for a mainstream outlet again (where she somehow keeps getting jobs). The wildly popular streamer Destiny, &lt;a href="https://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/1967735885526708371"&gt;who just said&lt;/a&gt; “you need conservatives to be afraid of getting killed when they go to events, so they look to their leadership to turn down the temperature,” should never appear on mainstream television again. It doesn’t matter that everyone yelled at him on air, why was he invited onto Piers Morgan in the first place? And editors at the New York Times should not be writing op-eds for Hasan fucking Piker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/1967735885526708371"&gt;who just said&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people, at most times, are looking for cues from other people on how to think and behave. In this way, our media institutions, our reality television stars, our writers, our musicians, our influencers do actually shape public opinion. We can’t tolerate anyone who shapes it in favor of political violence. Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the morality of this is somehow not obvious to you, or if you still aren’t convinced this is a meaningful problem, allow me to make one final practical point. In failing to police such behaviors, while concurrently policing conservative overreaction to such behaviors, perception on the right — and I am not accusing you of this, I am just explaining reality — is that you, best case, do not care if they die. You do not care if their friends die. You do not care if their beloved family members die. Worst case, you actually want them to die. My intention in pointing this out is not to appeal to your empathy here, but to your sense of self-preservation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this perception of left-wing callousness is not addressed, which can by the way easily be addressed by way of strong maintenance of the taboo against violence, it will change the right. And the version of the right that presently only lives in your most uncharitable arguments online will begin to manifest in reality. The young right will begin to mirror the young left, and become more accepting of violence. Further violence will follow. When that violence follows, there will be fewer platitudes denouncing violence, and more justifications. We should all be afraid of a future like that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not even sure, at this point, we can alter course. I am only asking that you see we are presently on this course, see the role you are even now, if inadvertently, playing in our society’s lurch toward hell, and help.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sam Altman and Tucker Carlson Discuss: Should ChatGPT Be More Christian?</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/what-happened-tucker-carlson-sam-altman-interview</link>
      <description>recapped: a tense debate about whether AI will subtly guide us toward moral disasters</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Honestly, Lord bless Sam Altman for doing this interview. And whoever he has now fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Sam joined &lt;a href="https://tuckercarlson.com/tucker-show-sam-altman"&gt;Tucker Carlson&lt;/a&gt; on his show. And I mean, right from the jump, it is evident that he walked straight into the Lion’s Den, which is to say Elon’s den, as apparently Tucker and Elon, who publicly hates Sam, are homies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://tuckercarlson.com/tucker-show-sam-altman"&gt;Tucker Carlson&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview is going viral in large part because Tucker grilled Sam on the death of Suchir Balaji, an OpenAI researcher and whistleblower. But really, that (admittedly very entertaining) five-minute section was a sidebar in a larger and more fascinating conversation about to what degree ChatGPT — and AI in general — should abide by Christian (or at least American, or at least Western) principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one corner, you have Tucker, who has previously said he was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/tucker-carlson-demon-attack?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;mauled by a “demon”&lt;/a&gt; or “something unseen” that left bleeding claw marks on his sides while he slept, an experience that left him “seized with this very intense desire to read the Bible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/tucker-carlson-demon-attack?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;mauled by a “demon”&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point being: Tucker is a pretty hardcore Christian now (*nervous laughter*), with a somewhat (maybe we could call it) &lt;em&gt;rigid&lt;/em&gt; view of how the world should be. Right and wrong is black and white. It’s literally written down, in the Bible, what we, as humans, should do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;rigid&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So from that vantage point, he’s incredibly skeptical of ChatGPT. Here you have this app, which has a “kind of autonomy or a spirit within it,” that some 700 million people every week are turning to for answers, like a kind of religion. It influences human behavior, it changes our assumptions about the world and each other, and “The Graphs” (lol) suggest it will have more power, concentrated among elites in Silicon Valley, than people. Given all that — &lt;em&gt;just like other religions&lt;/em&gt; — AI should have transparent moral frameworks, Tucker said. A kind of catechism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;just like other religions&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The beauty of a religion is it admits it’s a religion and it tells you what it stands for. The unsettling part of this technology, and not just your company but others, is that I don’t know what it stands for — but it does stand for &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;,” Tucker told Sam. “And unless it admits that and tells us what it stands for, then it guides us in a kind of stealthy way toward a conclusion we might not even know we’re reaching.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the other corner, you have Sam, a self-described “tech nerd” who definitely doesn’t view ChatGPT as a divine entity, but rather a “big computer” producing words that correspond to very advanced math. He said in this interview that he’s Jewish, but I suspect that Sam, given his rigorous meditation practice and just the way he speaks, also sees the world with a certain degree of non-dualism. (Here’s a “&lt;a href="https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/a-non-definitive-non-guide-to-non"&gt;Non-Definitive Non-Guide to Non-Duality&lt;/a&gt;” by the writer Sasha Chapin for more context on the idea.) But basically, non-dualists believe that the artificial boundaries we assign to reality (like right versus wrong) are, well, artificial. And those boundaries, which fuel a sense of separation from other beings (Such and Such is &lt;em&gt;Bad&lt;/em&gt;), actually perpetuate, you know, “bad” stuff. Wars. Hatred. Etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/a-non-definitive-non-guide-to-non"&gt;Non-Definitive Non-Guide to Non-Duality&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bad&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point being: Sam does not want ChatGPT to constitute a moral authority. He wants it to be a tool that adults can use — with guardrails that don’t overly trump their autonomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Tucker would have ChatGPT’s “catechism” basically be the Bible, what it actually has is a “&lt;a href="https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-09-12.html"&gt;model spec&lt;/a&gt;,” a transparent accounting of how it works. (More on that later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://model-spec.openai.com/2025-09-12.html"&gt;model spec&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where Tucker sees a potential radical concentration of unchecked power, Sam sees AI actually distributing power (knowledge, science, companies) quite broadly among many pockets of people with differing views. Where differing views are okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And honestly, I find myself going back and forth on who to root for. Like tolerance for different worldviews sounds nice in this climate. But. Would I feel less creeped out walking around SF today if the people in charge seemed to coalesce around a moral vision?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Yeah.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HUMANITY’S PREFERENCES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HUMANITY’S PREFERENCES&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;HUMANITY’S PREFERENCES&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So what are your spiritual views?”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Tucker asked Sam just three minutes into what would be a very long 56 minutes. (For Sam.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Um. I’m Jewish and I would say I have a fairly traditional view of the world that way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So you’re religious. You believe in God?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m not a literalist on the Bible, but I’m not someone who says ‘I’m culturally Jewish.’ If you ask me, I would just say I’m Jewish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But do you believe in God? Do you believe that there is a force larger than people that created people, created the earth, set down a specific order for living, that there’s an absolute morality attached that comes from that God?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think probably like most other people, I’m somewhat confused on this, but I believe there is something bigger going on than can be explained by physics, yes,” Sam said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Why not just say yes? Lol.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So you think the earth and the people were created by something, it wasn’t just like a spontaneous accident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It does not feel like a spontaneous accident, yeah. I don’t think I have the answer. I don’t think I know exactly what happened, but I think there is a mystery beyond my comprehension here going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Have you ever felt communication from that force or from any force beyond people? Beyond the material?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, not really.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fairness to Sam, not everyone has the good fortune to be attacked by demons in their sleep. But Tucker was quite unsatisfied. It didn’t seem, to him, that Sam was appealing to a higher power. And in that case, what was governing ChatGPT?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>We Have to Look: The Reactions to Charlie Kirk's Assassination</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/we-have-to-look-the-reactions-to</link>
      <description>a catalog of the justifications and celebratory reactions to the murder of charlie kirk</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As stories like this become more chaotic, we tend to forget about reactions to them in the moment. Later, such reactions are rewritten. That can not happen again. For posterity: a catalog of the justifications and celebratory reactions to the murder of Charlie Kirk. Please contribute everything we missed in the comments below. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;As stories like this become more chaotic, we tend to forget about reactions to them in the moment. Later, such reactions are rewritten. That can not happen again. For posterity: a catalog of the justifications and celebratory reactions to the murder of Charlie Kirk. Please contribute everything we missed in the comments below. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Kirk was shot in the throat by an assassin yesterday, and died shortly after. Millions of people watched. His children, one day, will watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fallout has been immense, and will likely alter our country in ways impossible to predict. We are now in a state of information chaos, with details of the assassin still unknown, and — I am assuming — all manner of mis- and disinformation coursing the news and social media. Reaction from the right is one of mourning, which is not only to say sadness but anger. I anticipate it will follow on like this for many days. Reaction from the left has mostly been, at the more positive end, unhelpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I dig in, however, I want to first point out Cenk Uygur, who has produced the only really helpful commentary from the left I’ve seen so far. He is clearly just taking five minutes to empathize and relate with a lot of people in pain, and express, very competently, that he is standing beside them at this moment. I was moved by a &lt;a href="https://x.com/ClownWorld_/status/1966027767302205590"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; of him last night, and then today by the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/ClownWorld_/status/1966027767302205590"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/eb84fc0a-7116-4b31-9fb1-104529fd8083_1064x1154.png"/&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/cenkuygur/status/1966005802084479210"&gt;@cenkuygur&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of writing that helps us remember we’re all human. It matters. Thank you, Cenk (seriously).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now we’re moving onto the dunces. My purpose here is not to shame these people. My earnest hope is by the end of this record, I can persuade most reasonable elements of the left of a very real problem nobody wants to face. My hope is only that you look. I just want you to see it. Then, come to your own conclusions. &lt;em&gt;But you have to look.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;But you have to look.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, the New York Times’ Ezra Klein had the following to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f0de0a50-a3ee-471f-9c88-d728674f12f9_1046x972.png"/&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/ezraklein/status/1965887366683652146"&gt;@ezraklein&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great. It is obviously true that America has a violence problem, in terms of armed assaults, domestic violence, and mass shootings, including another high school shooting just yesterday that barely cracked the news. It is also obviously true that America has a &lt;em&gt;political&lt;/em&gt; violence problem, and that no political party is immune to crazy people in their ranks doing awful, crazy things. But, after yesterday, I just don’t have it in me to lie to myself anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;political&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the exception of the Minnesota shooting, a haunting, monstrous act — which, despite this week’s bizarre insistence to the contrary, everyone denounced at the time — Ezra’s examples of, as they seem to be framed, violence committed by the right against the left, are categorically different than what happened yesterday to Charlie Kirk. The inclusion of January 6th, which preceded Ezra’s unmentioned &lt;em&gt;six months of BLM rioting&lt;/em&gt; that resulted in dozens of deaths across the country, is especially infuriating. Paul Pelosi’s attack wasn’t political at all, though it was terrible, and reaction to that attack, while certainly not appropriate, was generally focused on the weirdness of the initial police and news reporting that seemed to paint the picture of a gay love affair gone wrong. There was no mass hope for Paul Pelosi to die. There were no calls for further dead Democrats. There were gay jokes, mostly. Again, bad. Yet more similar to what happened to Rand Paul, who was brutally attacked by his neighbor over yard waste. Yes, the left loved that too. And both of these stories are categorically different than what happened yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;six months of BLM rioting&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But rather than focus on a tit-for-tat “who is more violent?” competition, my intention is for us to focus on the country’s reaction to political violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson led immediately to the leftist canonization of Luigi Mangione (&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-killer-inside-you"&gt;as I covered at the time&lt;/a&gt;), and that public glazing extended well beyond the typical media psychopaths. Sitting politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Elizabeth Warren tacitly justified the attacks, then pivoted to discussing healthcare — Luigi’s obsessed cause. Thus, rewarding his behavior, they guaranteed it would haunt us for the rest of our lives. Today, you can buy Luigi merch online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-killer-inside-you"&gt;as I covered at the time&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were similar reactions on the left after both attempted Trump assassinations, the killing of Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner this summer, and now Charlie Kirk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 24 hours since Charlie’s assassination, justifications and outright celebrations from left wing Americans have flooded every major social media platform. We are sharing them here, so we can refer back to this record as the conversation on violence in this country becomes confused, probably purposefully by people who do not want to face, for political reasons, what is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, you will always be able to find examples of crazy people saying crazy things after every act of violence, in every direction. But the scale of what we tend to see is incomparable to anything we are witnessing now, and most of this, much of what we are cataloguing, has come from people with no fear whatsoever of sharing their identity. These are not Russian bots, or anonymous rage farming Pakistanis. These are public school teachers, college students, defense contractors, actual government employees. The reason they are so apparently relaxed sharing such truly heinous and horrifying sentiments, with no fear at all for their jobs, is they have internalized a sense, from our culture, that violence against right-wing people is justified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been told for many years that “words are violence.” This has only ever meant, with no exception, right-wing words. Whether you agree, or disagree, with the notion right-wing words are violence (they are not, &lt;em&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/em&gt;), that is the culture that has produced such an unthinkable normalization of heinous grizzly murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Jesus Christ&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming majority of liberals do not think this way. Most American leftists do not think this way. But&lt;a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/progressives-political-violence-donald-trump-assassination-attempt"&gt; polling&lt;/a&gt; indicates a lot of leftists do. An enormous number of leftists. And&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/07/democrats-trump-resistance-violence-congress"&gt; reporting&lt;/a&gt; indicates this is reshaping Democratic politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/progressives-political-violence-donald-trump-assassination-attempt"&gt; polling&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/07/democrats-trump-resistance-violence-congress"&gt; reporting&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am hoping, perhaps stupidly, that liberals who fancy themselves thoughtful, good people will look at this, and will reflect honestly on what is very obviously a large, open, and growing movement on the far left in favor of literally murdering people they do not agree with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will say it again, because it is so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You at least need to look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Celebrations&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, as the ongoing leftist fetish for violence thing mainstreams, it turns out many of these people are losing their jobs. A lengthy thread here worth checking out, with many more examples updated in the comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f15aef83-04ba-4c4a-93ba-a448f4aa8494_1056x376.png"/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, an endless flood of requests for further murder on Bluesky. Though, I must note, unlike most of what we've shared here I have no idea who these people are. Judging by the overall tone of the week, my sense is much of this is coming from Americans who really believe this stuff. But some of this could be a foreign op, or bots, really anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/65d306e8-428d-4bbc-b2fd-1e52601bbf6f_1200x1200.jpeg"/&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Justifications&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are drawing a distinction between outright celebrations above, and justifications below. While the comments above are unambiguously insane, my sense is at least some of the stuff below would find defense on the left. People are emotional. People are just saying things. People want attention, really, is all this is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this, especially from sitting government officials — who should only be saying, in unison, this is absolutely outrageous and must never happen again — is innocent. The outright celebrations we’ve seen could not exist if there weren’t a culture priming us for this behavior. And the posts below are actively contributing to that culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, and of course, we have Mehdi Hasan and Ilhan Omar, two immigrants to our country tacitly endorsing the murder of a young American father. Love our new neighbors! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b49cf4ef-04ef-4f83-8998-1b238cdbfbb6_1064x982.png"/&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/EndWokeness/status/1966218569194377656"&gt;@EndWokeness&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CA State Senator Scott Wiener took a break from defending sex criminals this afternoon to remind us Kirk should not have died, but deserved to die: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bcf02dd5-72f1-4a87-97f7-3529f3892873_1176x542.png"/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the hours following Kirk's assassination, Steven King shared a fake claim that Kirk believed gay people should be stoned to death. He has since apologized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/01204fa7-548a-41ca-a895-1399245db32d_948x1576.png"/&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/StephenKing/status/1966484038648021264"&gt;@StephenKing&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSNBC analyst Matthew Dowd was fired for saying Charlie Kirk was a “divisive younger figure” who is “constantly pushing hate speech aimed at certain groups,” concluding with: “hateful thoughts lead to hateful words which then lead to hateful actions.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Apple Should Make Lamps</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/apple-should-make-lamps</link>
      <description>and washing machines. and printers. and anything besides thinner iphones.</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Apple had its biggest product launch of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the event, which Apple unironically promoted as “Awe Dropping,” the company announced big design upgrades for the iPhone, new smartwatches and AirPods, and, finally, the star of the show: a new iPhone 17 Air with an ultra-thin body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, you kind of have to hand it to Apple. These iPhones are so darn good that all that’s left, improvement-wise, is&lt;em&gt; making them 33% thinner. &lt;/em&gt;A precursor to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-07/apple-s-iphone-17-air-event-which-new-iphone-should-i-buy-iphone-17-pro-mf9n5f9g?srnd=undefined"&gt;foldable iPhones&lt;/a&gt;, they say. I get it. &lt;em&gt;The arc of innovation is long, but it bends toward (back to?) foldable phones&lt;/em&gt;. Or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt; making them 33% thinner. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-07/apple-s-iphone-17-air-event-which-new-iphone-should-i-buy-iphone-17-pro-mf9n5f9g?srnd=undefined"&gt;foldable iPhones&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The arc of innovation is long, but it bends toward (back to?) foldable phones&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, let’s talk about the word “awe.” That indescribable feeling of brushing up against the divine, such that it almost hurts, because you don’t want it to end. Do I even need to say it? A precursor to foldable iPhones might be an impressive feat of engineering, but it doesn’t invoke literal awe. It just doesn’t. Come to think of it, neither does anything Apple has shipped in a good long while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Apple really wants to drop some awe, it should make lamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple should make lamps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, you either get it or you don’t get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I mean?????? Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s 2,800 words explaining why Apple should make lamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ae5b5ac0-3732-4201-ab85-e0170b0426ae_470x645.png"/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;LAMPS, WASHING MACHINES, AND PRINTERS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;LAMPS, WASHING MACHINES, AND PRINTERS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;LAMPS, WASHING MACHINES, AND PRINTERS&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is widely considered to be losing the AI race. Badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-sad-state-of-affairs-at-apple-an-interview-with-david-heinemeier-hansson"&gt;Siri is still a joke&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-03/apple-plans-ai-search-engine-for-siri-to-rival-openai-google-siri-talks-advance"&gt;Apple is bleeding AI talent&lt;/a&gt;, mainly to Meta. And culturally (spiritually, even), Apple is struggling. The company, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-18/how-apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai-went-so-wrong?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;as Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported in a very detailed feature that you should go read&lt;/a&gt;, isn’t really built for the frenetic chaos that is the AI market right now. It’s averse to big, risky bets and acquisitions. Its commitment to data privacy has hindered the training of its models (that’s cool for us; bad for Apple lol). And, strangely, key executives like Craig Federighi, Apple’s head of software, and John Giannandrea, the head of AI research who formerly oversaw Siri, just… didn’t think customers wanted products like ChatGPT. So it follows that its blockbuster success, at 700 million weekly users, not only blindsided Apple — it forced these execs to sprint on projects they seemingly never believed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-03/apple-plans-ai-search-engine-for-siri-to-rival-openai-google-siri-talks-advance"&gt;Apple is bleeding AI talent&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-18/how-apple-intelligence-and-siri-ai-went-so-wrong?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;as Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported in a very detailed feature that you should go read&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple loves to come from behind. It didn’t launch the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; MP3 players, smartphones, tablets, watches, and earbuds — it launched the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; ones, as Gurman wrote: “The company is often content to wait for competitors to pioneer new tech, with all the risks that entails, before releasing its own well-designed, highly accessible version to its billion-plus customers.” But with AI, this approach is suddenly very risky. While Apple flails, AI could make the iPhone “irrelevant within a decade,” Eddy Cue, a senior Apple VP, recently said in a federal court appearance, per Gurman; since the dawn of AI search options like ChatGPT, the number of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-03/apple-plans-ai-search-engine-for-siri-to-rival-openai-google-siri-talks-advance"&gt;Google search queries from Apple devices&lt;/a&gt; has dropped for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-03/apple-plans-ai-search-engine-for-siri-to-rival-openai-google-siri-talks-advance"&gt;Google search queries from Apple devices&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…you know what &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; be irrelevant within a decade?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamps. Washing machines. Printers. None of which have seen any substantial innovation. All necessary, mostly every day — all getting more expensive, and &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt;. Have you &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; tried to print &lt;em&gt;anything?&lt;/em&gt; Have you tried to use a new washing machine to wash clothes? Have you ever tried to buy something nice? It leads to 30 open tabs and decisive defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;anything?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are entire, thriving businesses built on the backs of these decisive defeats. One called &lt;a href="https://www.pghcitypaper.com/news/macbid-gives-amazon-returns-and-employees-rebuilding-their-lives-a-second-chance-28032232?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;MAC.BID&lt;/a&gt;, an online auction-er with more than 20 US locations, buys oversized pallets of the garbage that people return to Amazon, Walmart, and Wayfair, and then sells all of it starting at $1 to people looking for steep deals. Part of the idea is giving another life to the &lt;a href="https://www.pghcitypaper.com/news/macbid-gives-amazon-returns-and-employees-rebuilding-their-lives-a-second-chance-28032232?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;5 billion pounds of return-generated waste&lt;/a&gt; each year, but since I’ve been a customer of MAC.BID, I’ve seen the truth with my own eyes: crap. Crap for miles, crap enough to fill a football stadium, evidence of the sins of consumerism — dishwashers, suitcases, tiny plastic trucks that kids can drive, 55-inch flat-screen TVs, patio furniture, box fans, God-awful grills — that you can bet your 90% discount is heading straight to the landfill. If not now, very very soon. Because why? Because it’s all made in China, dammit! It’s enough to drive good people to seek revenge against inanimate objects. In fact, my family made a Christmas tradition out of it. Each year, after gifts, we’d gather around the porch while my dad shot, with a shotgun, that year’s collection of broken Chinese appliances. Call it catharsis — and one small comfort, when crap crapped out, that you could shoot it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.pghcitypaper.com/news/macbid-gives-amazon-returns-and-employees-rebuilding-their-lives-a-second-chance-28032232?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;MAC.BID&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That right there… is the best we can do for our homes in the age of so-called &lt;em&gt;superintelligence&lt;/em&gt;? It’s honestly funny that the furthest we’ve come with home tech is the Roomba and the much less useful Alexa. I judge every human being who talks to an Alexa every day. I’m sorry, perhaps it’s some unexamined rot in my psyche, but I think that you are dumb. The home doesn't need new gadgets as much as it needs to be reimagined — made simpler, more beautiful. &lt;em&gt;This could be something, I tell you!&lt;/em&gt; Great, amazing, heavy-ass appliances, sage-colored with brass details, with a &lt;em&gt;services&lt;/em&gt; component. One hundred dollars per month, or whatever, for infinite repairs, forever. Apple, under pressure from the administration to move one iota of its Chinese and Indian supply chain to the US, could keep trying to get Trump off its back with half measures (it’s agreed to make &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/08/apple-corning-to-manufacture-all-iphone-apple-watch-cover-glass-in-kentucky/"&gt;iPhone glass&lt;/a&gt; in Kentucky), or: it could hire and train repair teams for Apple Home products, in conjunction with trade schools and community colleges, whilst increasing, somehow, the lifetime value of we plentiful Apple customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;superintelligence&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This could be something, I tell you!&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;services&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/08/apple-corning-to-manufacture-all-iphone-apple-watch-cover-glass-in-kentucky/"&gt;iPhone glass&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it could make lamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MAKING A ‘JOYFUL’ COMPUTER&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MAKING A ‘JOYFUL’ COMPUTER&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;MAKING A ‘JOYFUL’ COMPUTER&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason I’m into lamps, okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like small, stained-glass Tiffany lamps. I like big curvy floor lamps. I like how, when you walk into a restaurant that has the lighting figured out, a part of your insides relaxes. &lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt; think it’s the not-too-loud music. But &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; know it’s the lamps. It’s the beauty that we can make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple used to make beauty as a matter of strategy. It still does, I suppose. But that intensity used to be radical. Category-making. Category-&lt;em&gt;defining&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;defining&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take it from Steve Jobs. In 1997, he returned to Apple, after being ousted a decade prior, with harsh words. His mission: save the company from the brink of bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s wrong with this place?” Steve said from the stage of Apple’s auditorium, according to the biographer Walter Isaacson. “The products suck! There’s no sex in them anymore!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jony Ive, the famous designer, was sitting in the back of the room, per &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/01/technology/jony-ive-apple-design.html"&gt;the journalist Tripp Mickle&lt;/a&gt; in the book &lt;em&gt;After Steve: How Apple Became a Trillion-Dollar Company and Lost Its Soul&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/01/technology/jony-ive-apple-design.html"&gt;the journalist Tripp Mickle&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;After Steve: How Apple Became a Trillion-Dollar Company and Lost Its Soul&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, Jony got his first assignment from this irritated CEO: make a computer that was “joyful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jony did just that, designing the first colorful Mac in 1998. Its blue-green shade was literally “inspired by the waters of Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, where one of the designers surfed,” Mickle wrote. These now-iconic colorful computers with translucent shells — Bondi Blue, then the “Five Flavors” (grape, tangerine, lime, strawberry, and blueberry) — marked, as &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/01/imacs-spell-death-to-beige-boxes/"&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt; put it at the time, “the beginning of a long-overdue renaissance in computer design.” Pithy marketing slogans like “Sorry, no beige” and “Chic, not geek” in billboards and magazine spreads helped the iMac become the first mainstream symbol of tech &lt;em&gt;coolness&lt;/em&gt;. Sales went berserk, the company was basically rescued, and Steve 2.0 had his first big victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/01/imacs-spell-death-to-beige-boxes/"&gt;Wired&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;coolness&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b4a5d3b1-3e9b-4c3b-b2ad-e2a0c64a0101_600x379.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve came to call Jony his “spiritual partner,” per Mickle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in, they believed they were pursuing some essential somethingness — together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When his friend died in 2011, Jony, lost in grief, suffered the additional loss of watching Tim Cook bring Apple into its &lt;em&gt;operational efficiency&lt;/em&gt; era. (Barf.) Tim was tapped for the gig because he’s a “logistics bean counter” who is “exceptionally good at what he does, which is to negotiate with Chinese subcontractors and ensure that there's X amount of parts available at this moment in time,” as &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-sad-state-of-affairs-at-apple-an-interview-with-david-heinemeier-hansson"&gt;the entrepreneur DHH&lt;/a&gt; put it to me in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;operational efficiency&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-sad-state-of-affairs-at-apple-an-interview-with-david-heinemeier-hansson"&gt;the entrepreneur DHH&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was: he sucked all the crazy out of the place. The Chief Executive Bean Counter shifted the company’s focus from making devices to developing services (iCloud storage, Apple Music, etc.), which had better profit margins. He replaced top creatives with Suits. And he seemed to give approximately zero fucks about that essential somethingness (beauty?) that had once united Jony and Steve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas Steve visited Jony’s design studio almost every day, and nearly canceled the introduction of the Bondi Blue when he discovered that it featured a (less beautiful) CD tray instead of a (more beautiful) empty slot — the Bean Counter in Chief’s visits to the design team were rare and spiritually dead. Once, in the middle of obsessing over the first Apple Watch down to the suppleness of the leather straps, Jony designed a camera for a charity auction, and the Big Bean Man stopped by for a rare chat: “Mr. Ive glowed as he detailed the designers’ work on the camera for Mr. Cook, who nodded expressionlessly,” Mickle wrote. Like, &lt;em&gt;ouch&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;ouch&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we wonder how Apple came to lose its edge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you feel sad right now? You should feel sad. &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-sad-state-of-affairs-at-apple-an-interview-with-david-heinemeier-hansson"&gt;DHH feels sad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-sad-state-of-affairs-at-apple-an-interview-with-david-heinemeier-hansson"&gt;DHH feels sad&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Apple has been this shining example of what this industry could be when someone cared obsessively about making really great stuff,” he told me in April. “They set the bar for everyone that I've known in terms of technology, in terms of design, in terms of almost everything — every parameter you could define a technology product on, Apple was leading. And now they've fallen so goddamn hard. It's like seeing, I don't know, Michael Jordan go back and try to play basketball in his fucking sixties. You're just like, dude, please don't do it. I have this image of you in my head where you're amazing and you won five championships in a row. Why would you embarrass yourself like this? And that's what it feels like with Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The industry needs Apple,” DHH said. “Right now, the industry doesn't have Apple. And that's sad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A SPIRITUAL PARTNERSHIP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A SPIRITUAL PARTNERSHIP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A SPIRITUAL PARTNERSHIP&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In El Segundo, the lads are onto something. It might be the best spiritual partnership in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Gundo, there’s no peerlessness. These hard-tech founders — working on water, energy, defense, mining, and the making of unsexy metal parts — have an ideology. They have a group chat. They think the US is facing an existential threat for which it’s “very not ready,” as Cameron Schiller, Rangeview’s cofounder and CEO, put it on the &lt;a href="https://x.com/ti_morse/status/1964014581745144143"&gt;podcast Relentless&lt;/a&gt; last week; and they think part of the solution is going backwards, which is to say: forwards. Recapturing the distinctly American spirit that “lifted humanity to a place that it has never been before” in the 60s, 70s, and 80s, Cam said. Entrepreneurs should make fatty bags, in other words, not by selling derivatives of derivatives or whatever (crypto founders should be publicly shamed, per Rainmaker’s Augustus Doricko) — but by solving important problems in the tangible world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/ti_morse/status/1964014581745144143"&gt;podcast Relentless&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/34e6bef4-5187-44d1-b144-f1b437a9d421_1600x856.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For a generation, it was seen as dishonorable to go and work in the real world,” Zane Mountcastle, CEO and cofounder of Picogrid, said on the podcast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided, in other words, that other countries should build things for &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;, while we did the services: moving other people’s money around and programming the software, he continued. But that is all shifting, in part because El Segundo companies are tapping into a broader desire among younger generations to do something more meaningful with their lives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do they want to go work as a software engineer at some Big Tech company where their greatest potential impact is adding 1% to the bottom line of a Fortune 500? That is the upper bound of where they can go. Is that a truly inspirational story? Or is the story — they can build the next generation of rockets or energy or water or parts?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it kind of funny that Apple could’ve been Gundo, but instead, Gundo is Gundo, and Apple is crypto bros and Chinese subcontractors and “services”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple should be shamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;…into making lamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE EVERYTHING ENGINE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE EVERYTHING ENGINE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;THE EVERYTHING ENGINE&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would it be like to “have Apple,” as sad DHH put it, in the era of AI?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn on your best lamp and stick with me for a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Jony has teamed up with Sam Altman to make… something for OpenAI. We don’t know exactly what it is. We know it’s a device meant to reimagine how people interact with technology instead of reinforcing the screen addictions that drive all manner of loneliness and vitriol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So… like a lamp?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LISTEN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s in a lamp, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Inside the Amazon Slop King's $3M Hustle</title>

      <description>he's exploiting gaps in the ebook market to sell (probably llm-generated) books about potty training and finance, among other topics — and recruiting an army to do the same</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In a post that went viral on X earlier this month, a man named Tommi Pedruzzi &lt;a href="https://x.com/TommiPedruzzi/status/1954921889631265242"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; to have made $3 million selling books on Amazon — without &lt;a href="https://x.com/TommiPedruzzi/status/1951635181812474270"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; a word. (The post was recently community-noted.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/TommiPedruzzi/status/1954921889631265242"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/TommiPedruzzi/status/1951635181812474270"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2c6c9396-104c-46c4-8624-6d56525bae75_1062x1522.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His first piece of advice for entrepreneurs wanting to build ebook businesses? “Stop writing interesting books.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predictably, people thought Pedruzzi was a tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Sixsmith, an editor at &lt;em&gt;The Critic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://x.com/BDSixsmith/status/1955173078767456408"&gt;captured&lt;/a&gt; the general response: “I’m 34. I sold my soul to Satan. But I wish someone had told me this brutal truth from the beginning. 1/ Stop trying to be a human being.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Critic&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/BDSixsmith/status/1955173078767456408"&gt;captured&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In a more recent post, he &lt;a href="https://x.com/TommiPedruzzi/status/1964699158297886925"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;: “The dumber you write, the richer you get.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/TommiPedruzzi/status/1964699158297886925"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pedruzzi’s online persona feels familiar and aspirational: viral threads explaining how to build a million-dollar business using AI; a 50k+ following on X; a girlfriend he claims is a Brazilian model; verdant backdrops featuring palm trees (I’d later find out he often travels to Bali). He has model-good looks and promises that you, too, can make “seven figures” generating and selling e-books, if you only listen to his advice and sign up for his course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrigued, I decided to investigate what this guy actually does. I expected to find someone making everything up just to sell a course — and while I found evidence suggesting that’s partly true, I also discovered a semi-legitimate, if ethically questionable, business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pedruzzi’s approach is smart. He uses AI to analyze best-selling books on Amazon, identifies common complaints in the reviews, then publishes “improved” versions under pseudonyms addressing those specific pain points. He also sells a course teaching others to replicate this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he’s not creating wholly original content — most of his books are AI-generated slop — he &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; found a way to exploit gaps in the market and occasionally delivers value to customers, however inconsistent. He represents the unglamorous reality of the creator economy: not the aspirational influencers with brand deals and free trips, but the small operators mixing legitimate business tactics with ethically dubious shortcuts, usually with a course attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a scam, but not entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/583f701d-2ccf-4ff8-a674-40aeba68fb12_1214x722.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pedruzzi trips alarm bells for people because he’s cagey about his book titles — besides throwing around figures like $3 million in revenue, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; is the thing that makes people think he’s just another scammer. He refuses to mention them on social media, and he wouldn’t tell me, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our initial Zoom call, Pedruzzi told me it would be easier for him to send me a portfolio of his book &lt;em&gt;covers&lt;/em&gt;, as opposed to links to individual books so I could get a feel for the type of work he published. He later direct messaged me a link to public-facing graphic design &lt;a href="https://www.behance.net/nespoladesignstudio"&gt;portfolio&lt;/a&gt; on Behance featuring cookbook and how-to book covers. When I later asked him to confirm those were his books and not graphic design portfolio, he backtracked, claiming they were “clients,” but not his books. But given that they fit the description of his business — I’m assuming they are, otherwise why would he have shown them to me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;covers&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.behance.net/nespoladesignstudio"&gt;portfolio&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cross-referenced the pseudonyms from the portfolio with Amazon listings and matching cover designs. Here’s one example: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Time-Saving-Potty-Training-Stress-Free-Montessori/dp/1801571201/ref=sr_1_3?crid=19WQTQWX4IDAU&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fW8f1WH2SH9ymkhicFseMHyHdvhhrIJmJ9zubqVfDQmjMk36ZJTegN8Wpp_JPc9StRtnk7eKMZZaRvIRuirioq0Fp0X5WfbXrAcinTy75egnmzSv3Z1jIUP0kpfnn-5S3Em5Yoh8s5ClPj23FFf0nVFezi94vu8ij51ecTuxObN6BGn5BruBxjsGwwXOADtDfYG5sR-_R2GFi4Uux22RMjI4lW0vZ-yFVlGtXGKrfM4.WtPI6x2V84s4ssBaARoJayqYZsYC6r7ZN8pi47E6Kgg&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=serena+white+potty+training&amp;amp;qid=1755889727&amp;amp;s=digital-text&amp;amp;sprefix=%2Cdigital-text%2C133&amp;amp;sr=1-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time-Saving Potty Training&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by “Serena White.” It reads like GPT-2 tier slop, and it’s loosely based on the most popular (non-slop) book about potty training (&lt;em&gt;Potty Training in Three Days&lt;/em&gt; by Brandi Bucks). Bucks, however, has received recurring &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1H9CN4TY5WL62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8"&gt;negative&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pottytraining/comments/110iiyf/24_hours_into_three_day_potty_training_method_and/"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; claiming the book ignores pooping (key to potty training, many are saying); Pedruzzi’s book, in response, features a section on constipation to meet market demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Time-Saving-Potty-Training-Stress-Free-Montessori/dp/1801571201/ref=sr_1_3?crid=19WQTQWX4IDAU&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fW8f1WH2SH9ymkhicFseMHyHdvhhrIJmJ9zubqVfDQmjMk36ZJTegN8Wpp_JPc9StRtnk7eKMZZaRvIRuirioq0Fp0X5WfbXrAcinTy75egnmzSv3Z1jIUP0kpfnn-5S3Em5Yoh8s5ClPj23FFf0nVFezi94vu8ij51ecTuxObN6BGn5BruBxjsGwwXOADtDfYG5sR-_R2GFi4Uux22RMjI4lW0vZ-yFVlGtXGKrfM4.WtPI6x2V84s4ssBaARoJayqYZsYC6r7ZN8pi47E6Kgg&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=serena+white+potty+training&amp;amp;qid=1755889727&amp;amp;s=digital-text&amp;amp;sprefix=%2Cdigital-text%2C133&amp;amp;sr=1-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time-Saving Potty Training&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Time-Saving Potty Training&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Potty Training in Three Days&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1H9CN4TY5WL62/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8"&gt;negative&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pottytraining/comments/110iiyf/24_hours_into_three_day_potty_training_method_and/"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another book from the Behance page, &lt;em&gt;The Handbook of Herbal Tinctures&lt;/em&gt;, starts: “However, the common understanding is that tinctures are created by immersing cannabis or other similar plants in a highly concentrated alcohol solution...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Handbook of Herbal Tinctures&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure that’s true, but it’s a nonsensical first sentence for a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ccade003-914a-4272-909d-ad15e8135b8c_1418x856.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the books I was able to track down sell poorly and receive negative (or mixed, at best) reviews. A series of books by “Eric Mallon” on how to use ChatGPT enjoy some &lt;a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/200-ChatGPT-Tips-Audiobook/B0DSQSPRDV?srsltid=AfmBOorcJPaze2mBKbwSzzAcqT_uH2-alYcAzRCPcgfo-N-HJ6Z0IIRJ"&gt;praise&lt;/a&gt; (“straight forward,” “a must have”), but elsewhere, people call them boring &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Turn-ChatGPT-Machine-Work-Home/dp/B0CJKK5C1M"&gt;drivel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.audible.com/pd/200-ChatGPT-Tips-Audiobook/B0DSQSPRDV?srsltid=AfmBOorcJPaze2mBKbwSzzAcqT_uH2-alYcAzRCPcgfo-N-HJ6Z0IIRJ"&gt;praise&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Turn-ChatGPT-Machine-Work-Home/dp/B0CJKK5C1M"&gt;drivel&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this to say, these aren’t exactly best sellers and easy passive income. These books are likely selling a few copies a month, if any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s probably why, with one early &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Revolutionary-Guide-Making-Money-Online/dp/1802243275"&gt;exception&lt;/a&gt;, Pedruzzi never, as far as I can tell, publishes under his own name. Instead, he creates SEO-optimized pseudonyms, copying the names of real people with enough online presence to seem legitimate after a quick Google search. “Eric Mallon” shares a name with the CTO of Qloud Games. “Ashley Kisner,” the name used for a cookbook, shares a name with a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AshleyKisner"&gt;YouTuber&lt;/a&gt; who at one point published dieting content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Revolutionary-Guide-Making-Money-Online/dp/1802243275"&gt;exception&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AshleyKisner"&gt;YouTuber&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pedruzzi uses the same strategy to optimize his book titles. His &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Insecure-Love-Eliminating-Jealousy-Relationship/dp/1801142114?ref_=ast_author_dp#customerReviews"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insecure in Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has a similar title to a bestseller by a licensed psychologist. This might explain why he’s so weird about revealing his titles, advising students in his course: “DO NOT SHARE BOOK TITLES. To respect the privacy of your business, we urge you not to share your titles or keywords in use.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Insecure-Love-Eliminating-Jealousy-Relationship/dp/1801142114?ref_=ast_author_dp#customerReviews"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insecure in Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Insecure in Love&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little touches like these are ethically dubious, but they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; clever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/086ce458-47ff-4bc7-b52a-c2cfad736b00_1454x1238.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After weeks of pressing Pedruzzi for proof of his $3m claim, he finally admitted “$3 million” wasn’t annual income but cumulative revenue since 2019. His actual yearly revenue was to $1.2 million, with a “substantial part” from his $99/month course, PublishingOS, which teaches other people how to create their own e-book empires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, like everything Pedruzzi touches, this course hovers at about 40 percent legitimate, never quite crossing into outright scam but never feeling honest either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The testimonials check out, but if you dig into the specifics of who’s &lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;the community, and that’s where things get weird. In just the few weeks I was reporting this piece, membership dropped from 304 to 273 — poor retention for a product supposedly teaching people to make thousands monthly. At $99/month, even peak membership only generates about $360,000 yearly before churn, and the churn appears significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5808e2e2-0b8f-48bc-99e5-8dfce5ebde09_1450x1146.jpeg"/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside the community, there’s tension. In one conversation, a skeptical user openly questions if anyone’s actually making money. Ross Thomson, claiming to be a successful student, gets defensive when (lightly!) challenged, insisting he has screenshots to prove success but refusing to share details. A user named David Sean jumps in and says it’s suspicious, asking “Are you refusing money from a potential customer?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8fb0e013-7580-490e-b7cf-13bd9fd47084_726x1210.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of Ross Thomson from Edinburgh, many of the users don’t seem real at all. &lt;a href="https://www.skool.com/@greier-stephanie-8498?g=publishingos-free"&gt;Greier Stephanie&lt;/a&gt;’s profile picture belongs to someone named &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/melanie-duford-1b27b718a/?originalSubdomain=ca"&gt;Melanie Duford&lt;/a&gt; on LinkedIn. &lt;a href="https://www.skool.com/@faye-justis-3239"&gt;Faye Justis’s&lt;/a&gt; picture is actually a woman named &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/denisecarter2009/"&gt;Denise Carter&lt;/a&gt;. When I tracked down actual members, either they’d made very little money (low hundreds) or had “just started their journey” (hadn’t made any money at all).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Abundant Delusion</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/abundant-delusion</link>
      <description>I snuck into the atlantic, home of the "abundance" movement, and argued the entire thing was doomed to fail</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Good morning, your boy was just published in &lt;em&gt;the Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;the Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For months now, I’ve watched the center left “lib out” over “abundance” with a mix of hopefulness, as I’m glad they’re finally embracing the concept, and anxiety, as I understand this is America in 2025, and we are not allowed to have nice things. The movement is pushing for material progress (infrastructure, energy, education, healthcare), while critiquing left-wing regulatory impediments to what are framed as left-wing goals (they aren’t, but more on that in a minute). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now right there on the ground floor, the problem with the movement is it is explicitly a left-wing project, or so it is explained in the book &lt;em&gt;Abundance&lt;/em&gt;, and the “left” in this country includes a wide range of people, from thoughtful, sensitive &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; writers to Luigi Mangione fetishists. This was always, eventually, going to be a problem for earnest libs. But this summer Zohran Mamdani ran for mayor, the “center left” began a slow and cautious dance with him, and it was time for me to address the subject.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Abundance&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; offered me the great opportunity to write for them, which I accepted. There is no better place for a piece like this, as &lt;em&gt;the Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; is the actual home of the abundance movement. I’m also just personally a great fan of their specific brand of lib. These are generally kind, thoughtful people I only sometimes disagree with, and when I do they meet that disagreement with openness. In this case, they literally reached out to me and asked for the disagreement. So, that’s pretty cool. And rare. And I’m proud of the collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;

      <title>Luigi Mangione: China's Next Top Model</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/chinas-next-top-model</link>
      <description>shein used the face of accused murderer luigi mangione to sell $12 shirts — and behind the fiasco is a full-blown luigi cult in china that western media has ignored</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Shein was called out this morning for using what appears to be an AI-generated image of alleged murderer Luigi Mangione to hawk a floral shirt. The listing, now scrubbed from the site but &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250903014800/https://m.shein.com/us/Men's-New-Spring/Summer-Short-Sleeve-Blue-Ditsy-Floral-White-Shirt,-Pastoral-Style-Gentleman-Shirt-For-Everyday-Wear,-Family-Matching-Mommy-And-Me-(3-Pieces-Are-Sold-Separately)-p-59358613.html?cdn_rsite=cf&amp;amp;ref=www&amp;amp;rep=dir&amp;amp;ret=mus"&gt;preserved&lt;/a&gt; on the Wayback Machine, was a masterpiece of viral slop, with an SEO word salad listing title: “Men’s New Spring/Summer Short Sleeve Blue Ditsy Floral White Shirt, Pastoral Style Gentleman Shirt For Everyday Wear, Family Matching Mommy And Me (3 Pieces Are Sold Separately).” Yes, you read that right — they were using an alleged assassin’s face to sell family matching outfits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250903014800/https://m.shein.com/us/Men's-New-Spring/Summer-Short-Sleeve-Blue-Ditsy-Floral-White-Shirt,-Pastoral-Style-Gentleman-Shirt-For-Everyday-Wear,-Family-Matching-Mommy-And-Me-(3-Pieces-Are-Sold-Separately)-p-59358613.html?cdn_rsite=cf&amp;amp;ref=www&amp;amp;rep=dir&amp;amp;ret=mus"&gt;preserved&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/68366cc4-9c9a-4e18-b146-2bf0c8876b32_640x1387.webp"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several news outlets and viral X account Pop Crave picked up the story, Shein issued their standard damage control statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The image in question was provided by a third-party vendor and was removed immediately upon discovery. We have stringent standards for all listings on our platform. We are conducting a thorough investigation, strengthening our monitoring processes, and will take appropriate action against the vendor in line with our policies.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“The image in question was provided by a third-party vendor and was removed immediately upon discovery. We have stringent standards for all listings on our platform. We are conducting a thorough investigation, strengthening our monitoring processes, and will take appropriate action against the vendor in line with our policies.”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, PR statement, but frankly, probably true — if you know anything about Shein, then you know how plausible their story is. Shein isn’t so much a fashion brand as it is a supply chain fever dream. Through their marketplace platform, they’ve created an ecosystem where thousands of suppliers list products directly, turning fashion retail into a high-speed fast fashion railway. As the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrylgvr77jo"&gt;BBC described it&lt;/a&gt;, Shein represents not a brand but a supply chain strategy — one where AI determines trends in real-time, factories pump out micro-batches based on social media engagement, and individual vendors throw whatever they think will sell against the digital wall. They’re not designing clothes; they’re weaponizing data science against your credit card. Even as someone who loves capitalism — Shein is something else. It’s practically sci-fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrylgvr77jo"&gt;BBC described it&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whether this was an oversight, deliberate provocation, or culturally insensitive exploitation of someone’s popularity, there’s a massive cult of Luigi Mangione in China that Western media has largely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Five Years Later, Tech Is Still Censoring Kyle Rittenhouse</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/five-years-later-tech-is-still-censoring</link>
      <description>revisiting one of the most tyrannical smear and censorship campaigns in modern history, unleashed by the media and major tech platforms on a 17-year-old boy</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the time, I didn’t want to talk about Kyle Rittenhouse myself: not only was it impossible to push back against the media narrative surrounding him (a cold blooded murderer, and zero nuance allowed, let alone disagreement), the entire technology industry actively censored such pushback. Now, most of us have largely memory-holed the entire subject, including most of the people responsible for the information disaster. But we can’t let that happen. It’s long past time to revisit the story, to reflect on what truly happened — not only that night in Kenosha, but to our information ecosystem — and hopefully, to learn.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Independent journalist and video creator Matt Orfalea walks us through the smear campaign and its fallout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-Solana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;-Solana&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 25, 2020, after two nights of riots in Kenosha, Wisconsin, following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse volunteered to help clean up the destruction and protect local businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/262ea502-a7de-4461-91f8-7ed737cece76_5472x3648.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d0c79ee4-66f7-48d9-ac49-5ddb83d19be7_977x669.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After spending the morning cleaning graffiti off a high school near the Kenosha County Courthouse, Rittenhouse and his friend Dominick Black were asked to protect Car Source,¹ an immigrant-owned used car dealership in downtown Kenosha that evening. They went to Black’s stepfather’s house and returned to Car Source with rifles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dealership had suffered significant arson damage the previous nights. Rittenhouse also brought a medical kit to provide first aid, drawing on his training as a certified lifeguard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7f7c60ea-2ed2-496b-95d1-793b3db27f10_1096x1600.png"/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens next is chaotic. Videos published that night clearly show Rittenhouse being attacked. As Rittenhouse runs from Joseph Rosenbaum, a 36-year-old man who’d been released from a hospital earlier that day, Joshua Ziminski fires a gunshot into the air behind them. Rosenbaum chases after and then lunges at Rittenhouse, who shoots him four times in self-defense. After this first shooting, Rittenhouse attempts to flee toward police lines but he’s pursued by multiple people. During the pursuit, Rittenhouse is struck in the head, kicked by an unidentified assailant, and twice hit with a skateboard by Anthony Huber. Rittenhouse then fires again, killing Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz, 27, who was approaching with a handgun. The scene was horrific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more horrific was the smear campaign that followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media coverage systematically misrepresented these events. NBC News with Alison Morris cut out not only the jump-kick but the entire chase. Morris characterized Rittenhouse, who, again, was then a&lt;em&gt; 17-year-old-boy&lt;/em&gt; who’d fallen after being struck in the head, as “a man sitting in the middle of the street waving a gun at people running by.” MSNBC’s The Beat with Ari Melber likewise edited out crucial moments of the attack footage. Melber’s audience never saw Rittenhouse kicked in the face and hit with the skateboard before shots rang out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt; 17-year-old-boy&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an MSNBC Morning Joe segment, which didn’t show the attack footage, the host described it to viewers as Rittenhouse “just running around shooting and killing protesters.” Meanwhile, over at CNN, Anderson Cooper described Rittenhouse as “the white teenager under arrest in connection with a shooting attack on protestors in Kenosha overnight.” Democracy Now’s Amy Goodman claimed Rittenhouse was “shooting into a crowd,” while emphasizing that he was a “&lt;em&gt;white&lt;/em&gt; man.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;white&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even some Fox News pundits rushed to judgment. Chris Wallace said there was “no justification” for Rittenhouse’s actions (that is, his self-defense after being attacked), and Marie Harf repeatedly described him as guilty of “murder,” just two days after the shooting, more than a year before trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://streamable.com/adrw15"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8003fb27-2a7c-4dd8-a900-62c73dcb9d7e_1148x646.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, Facebook designated Rittenhouse a “mass murderer,” influencing his perception among its active userbase of 2.9b people. Mark Zuckerberg told CBS, “We spent a long time looking into this deeply, and we’ve designated him as a mass murderer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://streamable.com/e0g9qb"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/54368130-2028-4b3e-ae7f-133d59888b9e_1158x646.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook deleted Rittenhouse’s accounts and censored all search results for “Kyle Rittenhouse.” This continued well after the shooting, too. Other Big Tech giants — Google, Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter, the most visited sites in the world — also censored public discourse. Instagram removed comments sympathizing with Rittenhouse when he cried on the stand as he recounted having his life threatened by a large man with a gun, being ambushed, running away, and eventually being forced to defend himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/84e903e9-93e8-4324-ba73-d8cc94e55446_1046x1062.webp"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter censored the words “Kyle Rittenhouse did nothing wrong,” labeling the support for the 17-year-old who was attacked as “glorifying violence.” Users were forced to delete these tweets if they wanted to keep using Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/426130f4-0e2a-497b-bd50-331b5dd7af03_945x2048.webp"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TikTok removed even the most cordial discourse, like this clip from Brad Polumbo, accusing it of “harassment and bullying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://streamable.com/ninls3"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b9b73c35-c3f7-46f1-8179-2516a76657ea_1150x652.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, it was not considered bullying for the nation’s most powerful politicians to call for Rittenhouse’s &lt;a href="https://x.com/hakeemjeffries/status/1458547713381896193"&gt;extrajudicial imprisonment&lt;/a&gt; or to falsely accuse him of being a “&lt;a href="https://x.com/AyannaPressley/status/1298780540431224832"&gt;white supremacist&lt;/a&gt;” and “terrorist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/hakeemjeffries/status/1458547713381896193"&gt;extrajudicial imprisonment&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/AyannaPressley/status/1298780540431224832"&gt;white supremacist&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/32975e86-d538-4218-9cd8-3a8f9e303135_828x829.png"/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the public discourse in Rittenhouse’s favor was censored, the media continued to call him a murderer, ignoring key facts, and instead focusing on the utterly insignificant detail that Rittenhouse “crossed state lines” one mile from his home — as if that in itself were a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://streamable.com/wocuuf"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4ec1d794-5a39-452f-911e-980894b46fa8_1150x650.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Senate candidate Josh Mandel shared a meme mocking the incessantly repeated “crossed state lines” talking point, Facebook censored his post and threatened to delete his account. Facebook also censored video creator Mark Dice for sharing a non-graphic video of Rittenhouse bandaging an injured protester’s foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/69cc58cf-cec6-48b2-a875-fd0c86eb4a02_828x830.png"/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GoFundMe shut down Rittenhouse’s family campaign to raise money for his bail and legal defense. Both Facebook and Twitter censored users who shared other links to donate, including Rittenhouse’s lawyer and mother. When his mom shared a link to donate, Twitter disabled the retweet button. Discover, one of the world’s largest payment companies, blocked donations to Rittenhouse’s GiveSendGo fundraiser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ff947c7c-580f-4c94-ba98-833481cd6466_1456x506.png"/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discover did this without public announcement, but confirmed its actions after an internal email leaked. When Rittenhouse’s family attempted to raise defense funds by selling “Free Kyle” t-shirts, the printing platform, Printful, terminated the online store because they said Rittenhouse’s case was “controversial” and “complex.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shopify, one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world, also banned the sale of Rittenhouse shirts, which were being sold to raise defense funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/87022494-6739-481a-a573-0d99641d0e62_1456x975.png"/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this day (even after Rittenhouse’s acquittal), Google, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, and Bing ban searches for Kyle Rittenhouse merchandise in their online marketplaces. Yet they allow searches for merchandise advertising convicted serial killers and actual mass murderers, like Jeffrey Dahmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/98d2bbdd-a555-42a0-a70c-4d40c58a4b79_1456x903.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miraculously, after 87 days behind bars, Rittenhouse raised enough funds to pay the $2m bail. Then, after enduring over a year of harassment, smears, and censorship, he successfully defended himself again — this time in court. A jury acquitted him of all charges in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://streamable.com/qmg99j"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9de2b835-47f8-4ec2-ae21-80504b48e6a9_1156x648.png"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the overwhelming exculpatory evidence that led to his acquittal, ongoing tech censorship had a lasting impact on public opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cab751bc-132e-4dc6-a076-b771ea54d959_1456x1042.webp"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smear and censorship campaign, executed by both the media and major tech platforms, thoroughly convinced over a quarter of the population that Kyle Rittenhouse is a murderous monster. Public opinion still hasn’t caught up with the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—Matt Orfalea&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matt’s working on a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.givesendgo.com/KillingKenoshaFilm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;feature-length documentary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; on the Kenosha 2020 riots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;feature-length documentary&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt; on the Kenosha 2020 riots.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¹ The owners of Car Source, Khindri brothers, would later claim they “never asked” Rittenhouse to help defend their dealership, despite texts showing communication between them and conflicting testimony from other witnesses who said the owners welcomed the armed protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;² For context, Rittenhouse drove from Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha, Wisconsin, for work as a lifeguard. The drive is approximately 30 minutes long.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Ezra Klein Doesn't Understand How Immigration Works</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/ice-isnt-violating-due-process-its</link>
      <description>ezra klein, radley balko, and the new york times claim ice is "eviscerating" due process, but a close look at immigration law reveals they're wrong</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claim: &lt;/strong&gt;ICE is “eviscerating due process” when it arrests peaceful undocumented immigrants showing up to their court-scheduled hearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Claim: &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fact-check: &lt;/strong&gt;What ICE is doing is completely legal under a 29-year-old law (that many at the NYT evidently haven’t read).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fact-check: &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week on his podcast, Ezra Klein interviewed Radley Balko, a Substack writer and author of &lt;em&gt;Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America’s Police Forces&lt;/em&gt;. Balko argues Donald Trump is “building his own paramilitary force” and “eviscerating due process,” specifically in ordering ICE to detain undocumented immigrants who are calmly showing up for their court-mandated hearings. Here’s Balko:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Rise of the Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America’s Police Forces&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are seeing suspensions of due process for people who are here and undocumented. We’re seeing people being arrested &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;when they show up for their hearings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;when they’re &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;abiding by the law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, doing what they’re supposed to be doing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are seeing suspensions of due process for people who are here and undocumented. We’re seeing people being arrested &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;when they show up for their hearings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;when they’re &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;abiding by the law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, doing what they’re supposed to be doing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We are seeing suspensions of due process for people who are here and undocumented. We’re seeing people being arrested &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;when they show up for their hearings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;when they show up for their hearings&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;when they’re &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;abiding by the law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;abiding by the law&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;, doing what they’re supposed to be doing.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ezra watches intently, mournfully, obviously concerned — and as I watched, I was concerned, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why are undocumented people being yanked out of court?&lt;/em&gt; Ezra asks, and Balko replies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Why are undocumented people being yanked out of court?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The government is saying at these asylum hearings: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘We’re going to dismiss the government’s case against this person.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; So at that point, the person is no longer someone who went through the proper channels to legally request asylum. At that point, they are now just someone who is undocumented and here without authorization. So now ICE is legally permitted to detain them and sweep them up because they’re no longer in the asylum process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So now ICE is legally permitted to detain them and sweep them up because they’re no longer in the asylum process.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As I understand it, that is legally dubious, to say the least,” says Balko.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clips from this interview have been viewed by almost 800k people on YouTube and X; the podcast reached many more; one of the top comments on YouTube compares the U.S. to the Iranian dictatorship pre-revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious, and vaguely scared (as listening to a podcast episode threatening the “evisceration” of due process will make you), I read up on U.S. immigration law and spoke with two immigration attorneys (one current, another former). I wanted to figure out what’s actually going on here, legally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I learned: Radley Balko is wrong about what’s happening when undocumented people are arrested in courthouses. I’ll get to why. Ezra Klein took his falsehoods at face value, which may not surprise some but did surprise me. And neither of them understand U.S. immigration law.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>Is the 'Right-Wing Dark Money' in the Room With Us Right Now?</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/is-the-right-wing-dark-money-in-the</link>
      <description>taylor lorenz claims republicans spent decades engineering a "powerful media ecosystem" to steal our attention. in reality, democrats just coasted until they lost</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new Taylor Lorenz story in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; reveals details of a “dark money” operation founded to bolster progressive creators — and, in response, left-wing influencers are defensively claiming they’re not being bought. Lorenz and others are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; spreading&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a powerful new strain of copium: it doesn’t matter what democratic dark money is doing, they argue, because Republicans have done the same (and worse!) for “decades.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, after detailing how the Sixteen Thirty Fund, a progressive nonprofit, is paying some influencers up to $8,000/month to “push the party line,” Lorenz claims “Republicans have spent decades building up a powerful independent media ecosystem.” She provides just two examples: Tenet Media’s genuinely corrupt scheme to pay right-of-center podcasters like Tim Pool and Dave Rubin, and a half-a-million-dollar GOP operation with Creator Grid to “[connect] Republican candidates with the internet’s most powerful conservative influencers” in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorenz and her article’s subjects, like &lt;a href="https://x.com/briantylercohen/status/1961201488782578160"&gt;Brian Tyler Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, believe a shadowy conspiracy of conservative donors beat liberals to the punch. Harry Sisson has, predictably, &lt;a href="https://x.com/harryjsisson/status/1961191098467918097"&gt;echoed&lt;/a&gt; the same claim: “Republicans have been doing this on their side for years and nobody said anything.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Thiel Fellows Win</title>
      <link>https://www.piratewires.com/p/why-thiel-fellows-win</link>
      <description>peter thiel paid cracked teens to leave college and stay weird. now it's a $750b startup pipeline</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, September 26, 2010, Peter Thiel and Luke Nosek, the PayPal cofounder, were on a plane from New York to San Francisco, when they had an idea: paying people to leave college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter and a small team worked out minor details like &lt;em&gt;whether this was legally allowed&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and later the next day, he announced the &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/27/peter-thiel-drop-out-of-school/"&gt;first iteration of the Thiel Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; in an interview with TechCrunch. He’d give $100,000 to 20 people up to 20 years old — if they left school and started a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;whether this was legally allowed&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/27/peter-thiel-drop-out-of-school/"&gt;first iteration of the Thiel Fellowship&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The famous contrarian, who’d by this point accurately predicted both the dot com and housing crashes, believed America was under the spell of yet another bubble: higher education. Specifically, the Ivy League. The economics didn’t make sense (“You have to get rid of the future you wanted to pay off all the debt from the fancy school that was supposed to give you that future,” &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/10/peter-thiel-were-in-a-bubble-and-its-not-the-internet-its-higher-education/"&gt;Peter told TechCrunch’s Sarah Lacy&lt;/a&gt;). But even deeper than that: the allure surrounding the Ivy League was itself immoral. Society shouldn’t situate people’s “best hope for a better life,” as Sarah put it, “on something that is by definition exclusionary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/10/peter-thiel-were-in-a-bubble-and-its-not-the-internet-its-higher-education/"&gt;Peter told TechCrunch’s Sarah Lacy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If Harvard were really the best education, if it makes that much of a difference, why not franchise it so more people can attend? Why not create 100 Harvard affiliates?” Peter said at the time. “It’s something about the scarcity and the status.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outrage soon followed. &lt;em&gt;A billionaire bribing kids to forgo their futures?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/10/thiel-fellows-program-is-most-misdirected-piece-of-philanthropy-says-larry-summers/"&gt;Larry Summers&lt;/a&gt;, a former Harvard President (of course), called the Thiel Fellowship “the single most misdirected bit of philanthropy in this decade.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A billionaire bribing kids to forgo their futures?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/10/thiel-fellows-program-is-most-misdirected-piece-of-philanthropy-says-larry-summers/"&gt;Larry Summers&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today, as with many of Peter’s heretical positions, criticizing the higher ed bubble, wherein students are commonly paying upwards of $90,000/year to learn how to do laundry and read Chaucer, is mainstream. And the Thiel Fellowship is gaining notoriety for producing so-called “unicorns” (billion-dollar companies) at a supposedly &lt;a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/best-accelerator-world-y-combinator-thiel-fellowship/"&gt;higher rate&lt;/a&gt; than top accelerators. In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1953069914132238775"&gt;contested&lt;/a&gt; chart that went viral earlier this month, the fellowship is even beating out Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/best-accelerator-world-y-combinator-thiel-fellowship/"&gt;higher rate&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1953069914132238775"&gt;contested&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a2acca12-986b-46fb-b38a-9366409acb0f_539x407.png"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point being: turns out the fellows did not forgo their futures. They designed them to their liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I interviewed the early architects of the Thiel Fellowship, &lt;a href="https://www.1517fund.com/"&gt;Danielle Strachman and Michael Gibson&lt;/a&gt;, who’re now cofounders and general partners of the VC firm 1517 Fund, to learn about what makes a Thiel Fellow a Thiel Fellow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.1517fund.com/"&gt;Danielle Strachman and Michael Gibson&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s partially about preserving, and leaning into, your Weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GUMPTIOUS YOUNGS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GUMPTIOUS YOUNGS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;GUMPTIOUS YOUNGS&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, Peter hired Michael to help him teach a class at Stanford Law School on philosophy and technology. The two had bonded over their love of the philosopher René Girard, who came up with “mimetic theory,” the idea that human desire is imitative, and that competition causes conformity. Michael’s first day of work happened to be the chaotic birthday of the Thiel Fellowship. Danielle, who was skeptical of traditional education and herself, having started a charter school based on homeschooling philosophy, was hired by the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2010, they set about finding young geniuses to protect from higher-ed’s mimetic shenanigans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those early days, Peter had a phrase: “We’re looking for Howard Hughes, not Albert Einstein,” Michael said. Just like high IQ is only predictive of success up to a point, GPA and test scores weren’t too predictive of a fellow’s success in the wild, Danielle and Michael discovered. (In fact, winning the Intel Science Award became an instantaneous disqualifier - lol). They wanted some hard-to-pin-down, unnameable trait that maybe denotes high creativity? High agency?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We came to hear it — this urgency and excitement and competence in the way they would talk about their field of interests,” Michael said. “And they could scaffold the complexity of what they were talking about. They could go from a simple explanation to me, an outsider and ignoramus, to talking to an industry expert and being eye-to-eye with that person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the program itself, contrarianism thrived. The fellows loved competition, especially when it intersected with, um, manipulation, like in the game Werewolf, a routine feature of quarterly retreats. And they hated: structured and/or sanctioned wisdom-imparting. Fellows’ startups would have to be a little bit on fire, and &lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt; when they would come calling for something resembling, you know, help. But even then, Danielle said: they didn’t tend to take notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;that’s&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any sort of direct instruction was rejected. And we tried having speakers, we tried having workshops and they hated it,” Michael said. “They just really hated it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellows were mentored by people working in tech, sometimes by fellow Gumptious Youngs who dropped out of college. And so, mentors tended to lean in, even to the point of fighting each other in the elevator about who had the best advice for a given mentee. Plus the fellows hit it off. (Just take it from the &lt;a href="https://x.com/micsolana/status/1960025900629586180"&gt;fourth Hereticon baby&lt;/a&gt;: weirdos enjoy the company of other weirdos.) The first year, there wasn’t a moving requirement — but almost all of the fellows moved to the Bay Area anyway. Knowledge — like “founder-led sales is how you do things,” Danielle said— traveled through osmosis to younger classes, and they did a ton of business together, probably more so than your average incubator community, Danielle said. Because, in addition to a natural chemistry, the class sizes (20ish) are nice and small, especially compared to Y Combinator, which accepts roughly 500 startups each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://x.com/micsolana/status/1960025900629586180"&gt;fourth Hereticon baby&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It's a small group. It's not 5,000 people who are just wearing a t-shirt somewhere. They're people who have a shared experience of doing something difficult and bucking the system,” Danielle said. “That's what I would say is a big difference with Y Combinator — to be a Thiel Fellow, you had to be going up against something, typically. Going up against higher ed, going up against what your family believed, going up against what your friends were doing. That takes an incredible amount of conviction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Also probably helping Thiel Fellows: Peter’s brand.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;11-YEAR-OLD FOUNDERS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;11-YEAR-OLD FOUNDERS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;11-YEAR-OLD FOUNDERS&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Thiel Fellow-founded companies like Figma, Ethereum, Anthropic, and OYO Rooms have created more than $750 billion in value (which Molly O'Shea broke down in a recent interview with Danielle on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZI1oeQ85Ic"&gt;podcast Sourcery&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZI1oeQ85Ic"&gt;podcast Sourcery&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years into the fellowship, the writing was on the wall. Clear investment opportunities were shaping up, but since the fellowship offered just one-time grants, Danielle and Michael watched from the sidelines, even as fellows struggled to raise money for their earliest rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you told a VC you can never work with a founder you love again, they'd say, ‘What are you talking about?’” Danielle said. “The whole game is working with people who are great for as long as you possibly can.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, they left the Thiel Fellowship, electing to start a venture fund to fill the gap for fellows and similar upstarts, and the first person they pitched was Peter, who in classic Peter fashion, per Michael, said: “What do you believe is true that the rest of the world thinks is false?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our answer in that first meeting was ‘We think the Thiel Fellowship is the greatest investment opportunity that no one is taking advantage of’ — because that's how contrarian it was at that time,” he said.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their first fund, $20 million, returned more than $200 million to investors by 2020, placing the fund in the top 10 percent for that early investment stage. Today, Danielle and Michael are four funds deep, including a $100 million fund they’re still raising. Already, a handful of their companies are at Series A and Series B stages, including Mach Industries (defense) and Rainmaker (weather modification), founded respectively by Ethan Thornton and Augustus Doricko, both of whom Danielle and Michael referred into the Thiel Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now they’re taking the thesis even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A potential investor in 1517 recently asked us, ‘Where do you want to be in 15 years?’ And I said, without missing a beat, ‘I want to be backing 11-year-olds,’” Danielle said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It almost sounds like a joke, but 1517 is already mentoring people who’re ages 11-14 through various programs, including a teen camp — “because we’re just seeing that the frontiers of knowledge are much more accessible than ever before,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between AI, changing sentiment around college and independent study, as well as success stories like Figma’s Dylan Field and Anduril’s Palmer Luckey (two Gumptious Youngs who started their companies around the time they could drive) — Gen Z and Gen Alpha are leaning into entrepreneurship earlier and earlier, Michael and Danielle said. The self-taught are taking on things — energy, fusion, nuclear, etc. — that would've been out of reach just a decade prior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might blossom into a tech renaissance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Creativity is perishable and it ripens really early,” Michael said. “There are lots of people who talk about how maybe we could unify the country by having mandatory civil service for two years or conscription. And it’s just like, to me, that would be the greatest waste because we need variance — we need people exploring different things. And those years from 18 to 23 are so prime, we’ve just seen it. It’s like people are so creative, and sadly, you don’t stay that creative through your prime. You have a peak and then you tend to tail off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get older. You get married. You get a mortgage. People naturally don’t have the same level of output, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So we were the first program to basically say, no, look, there is an untapped resource right now,” he added. “It's trapped in this institution or this path. And if we just let them do something different, it's going to unlock a lot. The more we see that as a society, the better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/db725d9e-60e9-44d3-b4a2-0b01f3c09760_3986x2990.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;DON’T COMPETE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;DON’T COMPETE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;em&gt;DON’T COMPETE&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael and Danielle seem like the right people to back the unproven, because they don’t take themselves too seriously. Their site at 1517 proudly boasts “No Patagonia Vests,” and promises to help dropouts, renegades, and mad scientists “escape from captivity.” In the interview with me, over Zoom, they appeared together in-person. “This is important,” Danielle said while she physically poked Michael, who wore a car mechanic-looking suit that read: “Garage: parts and services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re the pit crew; we’re not the racer,” Michael said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is something like: “We’re going to change your tires.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s probably not surprising, then, that 1517 tends to attract the self-expressed. People for whom not being themselves is too high a cost to pay, come what may (risks, the ruffling of feathers, etc.). Take &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-crime-of-curiosity"&gt;Josie Zayner&lt;/a&gt; as an example. The 1517 portfolio founder and biohacking pioneer is a mad scientist, in a manner of speaking, but she’s also an “artist and provocateur,” Danielle said. One doesn’t &lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-crime-of-curiosity"&gt;livestream injecting oneself with a homemade Covid vaccine&lt;/a&gt; if one is not prepared to pay the price for being oneself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-crime-of-curiosity"&gt;Josie Zayner&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/the-crime-of-curiosity"&gt;livestream injecting oneself with a homemade Covid vaccine&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as AI stands to turn us into slop, maybe for those with enough gumption to follow their own compass, the opposite will be true. More and more youngs are already rejecting the traditional paths that whittle us all down into drooling paper-pushers. Per Danielle, the first year of the Thiel Fellowship received about 400 applicants. As of a few years ago, it was 80,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per Michael, drawing on René Girard, the man who (kind of) started it all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The basic syllogism is something like the more you compete along single dimensions, the more alike you become. And the more alike you become, the fewer unique thoughts you have. So with college, it's like everyone is competing to get these exclusive seats at Harvard and Yale. What people haven't been paying attention to is the conditioning that puts upon the people in that tournament. It makes them all alike. So you have a lot of people who are becoming more and more alike to get those few seats. And there are superficial differences between them, but it's like looking at the market for water. Can you really tell me the difference between Fiji Water, Smart Water, and Dasani? It's like, okay, the packaging is different. There's all fake differentiation. Really it's the same. I think that's true of Harvard applicants. So what Peter was allowing was like, ‘Hey, you don't have to participate in this tournament. And by not participating, your true individuality and uniqueness will emerge.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like that old WarGames quote: ‘The only winning move is not to play.’ So by not competing in this race, you're going to not become like those people,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
